# âœ¨ Haystack based QA system ðŸš€ [![Project Status: Active](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active) [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Prateek-Ralhan-brightgreen.svg?colorB=ff0000)](https://prateekralhan.github.io/)
A simple Question Answering system built on a corpus of documents of different formats using Haystack and Streamlit

## Installation:
* Simply run the command ***pip install -r requirements.txt*** to install the dependencies.

If you run into any issues with installation of haystack, please refer [this.](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack)


## Usage:
1. Clone this repository and install the dependencies as mentioned above.
2. Place your documents in the **docs** folder and simply run the following command in order to do bulk conversion of the documents to plain text: 
```
python data.py
```

3. We will convert the text documents into the haystack supported format and apply Preprocessor to clean and split the document into sensible units. We will store these preprocessed texts in a SQL document store. Run the following command to perform the indexing:
```
python index_pipeline.py
```

4. We will download our reader (a pre-trained transformer model on QA task) and also initialize our retriever to search top k relevant documents in document store.For a given question, the retriever will search for the top â€˜kâ€™ documents relevant to the question and reader will predict answers using those â€˜kâ€™ documents instead of searching the whole document store. In order to test this, you can run the following script:
```
python search_pipeline.py
```

## Web App
Here is our web app built using streamlit which is compatible with haystack and also it is easy to use. You can run the app by:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

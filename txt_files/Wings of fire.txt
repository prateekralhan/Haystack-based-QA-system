WINGS OF FIRE
An Autobiography
AVUL PAKIR JAINULABDEEN ABDUL KALAM has
come to personally represent to many of his countrymen the
best aspects of Indian life. Born in 1931, the son of a little
educated boatowner in Rameswaram, Tamilnadu, he had
an unparalleled career as a defence scientist, culminating
in the highest civilian award of India, the Bharat Ratna.
As chief of the country’s defence research and
development programme, Kalam demonstrated the great
potential for dynamism and innovation that existed in
seemingly moribund research establishments. This is the
story of Kalam’s rise from obscurity and his personal and
professional struggles, as well as the story of Agni, Prithvi,
Akash, Trishul and Nag - missiles that have become
household names in India and that have raised the nation to
the level of a missile power of international recokoning.
At the same time as he has helped create India’s
awesome weaponry, Kalam has maintained the ascetic
rigour of his personal life, working 18 hours a day and
practicing the veena. With characteristic modesty, Kalam
ascribes the greatness of his achievement to the influence
of his teachers and mentors. He describes the struggles of
his boyhood and youth, bringing alive everyday life in a
small town in South India and the inspirational role of
educators. He describes the role of visionary Indian
scientists, such as Dr Vikram Sarabhai, and of the creation
of a coordinated network of research institutions. This is
also the saga of independent India’s struggle for
technological self sufficiency and defensive autonomy – a
story as much about politics, domestic and international, as
it is about science.
Arun Tiwari worked under Dr APJ Abdul Kalam for
over a decade in the Defence Research and Development
Laboratory (DRDL), Hyderabad. He is currently Director,
Cardiovascular Technology Institute, Hyderabad, where he
is pursuing Dr Kalam’s vision of developing cost-effective
medical devices using indigenous defence technology.
Dr Kalam is now India’s President. He was elected to
India’s office by a huge majority in 2002.
To the memory of my parents
My Mother
Sea waves, golden sand, pilgrims’ faith,
Rameswaram Mosque Street, all merge into one,
My Mother!
You come to me like heaven’s caring arms.
I remember the war days when life was challenge and toil—
Miles to walk, hours before sunrise,
Walking to take lessons from the saintly teacher near the
temple. Again miles to the Arab teaching school,
Climb sandy hills to Railway Station Road,
Collect, distribute newspapers to temple city citizens,
Few hours after sunrise, going to school.
Evening, business time before study at night.
All this pain of a young boy,
My Mother you transformed into pious strength
With kneeling and bowing five times
For the Grace of the Almighty only, My Mother.
Your strong piety is your children’s strength,
You always shared your best with whoever needed the
most, You always gave, and gave with faith in Him.
I still remember the day when I was ten,
Sleeping on your lap to the envy of my elder brothers and
sisters It was full moon night, my world only you knew
Mother! My Mother!
When at midnight I woke with tears falling on my knee You
knew the pain of your child, My Mother.
Your caring hands, tenderly removing the pain
Your love, your care, your faith gave me strength
To face the world without fear and with His strength.
We will meet again on the great Judgement Day, My
Mother!

Preface
I
have worked under Dr APJ Abdul Kalam for over a
decade. This might seem to disqualify me as his
biographer, and I certainly had no notion of being one. One
day, while speaking to him, I
asked him if he had a message for young Indians. His
message fascinated me. Later, I mustered the courage to
ask him about his recollections so that I could pen them
down before they were buried irretrievably under the sands
of time.
We had a long series of sittings late into the night and
early under the fading stars of dawn—all somehow stolen
from his very busy schedule of eighteen hours a day. The
profundity and range of his ideas mesmerized me. He had
tremendous vitality and obviously received immense
pleasure from the world of ideas. His conversation was not
always easy to follow, but was always fresh and stimulating.
There were complexities, subtleties, and intriguing
metaphors and subplots in his narrative, but gradually the
unfolding of his brilliant mind took the form of a continuous
discourse.
When I sat down to write this book, I felt that it required
greater skills than I possessed. But realising the
importance of this task and regarding it an honour to have
been permitted to attempt it, I prayed earnestly for the
courage and calibre to complete it.
This book is written for the ordinary people of India for
whom Dr Kalam has an immense affection, and of whom
Dr Kalam is certainly one. He has an intuitive rapport with
the humblest and simplest people, an indication of his own
simplicity and innate spirituality.
For myself, writing this book has been like a pilgrimage.
Through Dr Kalam, I was blessed with the revelation that
the real joy of living can be found in only one way—in one’s
communion with an eternal source of hidden knowledge
within oneself—which each individual is bidden to seek and
find for himself or herself. Many of you may never meet Dr
Kalam in person, but I hope you will enjoy his company
through this book, and that he will become your spiritual
friend.
I could include in this book only a few incidents among
the many narrated to me by Dr Kalam. In fact, this book
provides only a thumbnail sketch of Dr Kalam’s life. It is
quite possible that certain important incidents have been
inadvertently dropped and that the contribution of some
individuals to the projects co-ordinated by Dr Kalam has
gone unrecorded. Since a quarter-century of professional
life separates me from Dr Kalam, some important issues
might also have remained unrecorded or have been
distorted. I am solely responsible for such shortcomings,
which are, of course, completely unintentional.

Arun Tiwari
This book is being released at a time when India’s
technological endeavours, to assert its sovereignty and
strengthen its security, are questioned by many in the world.
Historically, people have always fought among themselves
on one issue or another. Prehistorically, battles were fought
over food and shelter. With the passage of time, wars were
waged over religious and ideological beliefs; and now the
dominant struggle of sophisticated warfare is for economic
and technological supremacy. Consequently, economic
and technological supremacy is equated with political
power and world control.
Afew 
nations 
who 
have 
grown 
very 
strong
technologically, over the past few centuries, have wrested
control, for their own purposes. These major powers have
become the self-proclaimed leaders of the new world
order. What does a country of one billion people, like India,
do in such a situation? We have no other option but to be
technologically strong. But, can India be a leader in the field
of technology? My answer is an emphatic ‘Yes’. And let me
validate my answer by narrating some incidents from my
life.
When I first began the reminiscences that have gone
into this book, I was uncertain about which of my memories
were worth narrating or were of any relevance at all. My
childhood is precious to me, but would it be of interest to
anyone else? Was it worth the reader’s while, I wondered,
to know about the tribulations and triumphs of a smalltown
boy? Of the straitened circumstances of my schooldays, the
odd jobs I did to pay my school fees, and how my decision
to become a vegetarian was partly due to my financial
to become a vegetarian was partly due to my financial
constraints as a college student—why should these be of
any interest to the general public? In the end, I was
convinced that these were relevant, if not for anything else
but because they tell something of the story of modern
India, as individual destiny and the social matrix in which it
is embedded cannot be seen in isolation. Having been
persuaded of this, it did seem germane to include the
accounts of my frustrated attempt to become an Air Force
pilot and of how I became, instead of the Collector my
father dreamed I would be, a rocket engineer.
Finally, I decided to describe the individuals who had a
profound influence on my life. This book is also by way of a
submission of thanks, therefore, to my parents and
immediate family, and to the teachers and preceptors I was
fortunate to have had, both as a student and in my
professional life. It is also a tribute to the unflagging
enthusiasm and efforts of my young colleagues who helped
to realise our collective dreams. The famous words of Isaac
Newton about standing on the shoulders of giants are valid
for every scientist and I certainly owe a great debt of
knowledge and inspiration to the distinguished lineage of
Indian scientists, that included Vikram Sarabhai, Satish
Dhawan and Brahm Prakash. They played major roles in
my life and in the story of Indian science.
I completed sixty years of age on 15 October 1991. I had
decided to devote my retirement to fulfilling what I saw as
my duties in the
sphere of social service. Instead, two things happened
simultaneously. First, I agreed to continue in government
service for another three years and, next, a young
colleague, Arun Tiwari, requested me to share my
reminiscences with him, so that he could record them. He
was someone who had been working in my laboratory
since 1982, but I had never really known him well until the
February of 1987 when I visited him at the Intensive
Coronary Care Unit of the Nizam’s Institute of Medical
Sciences in Hyderabad. He was a mere 32 years old, but
was fighting valiantly for his life. I asked him if there was
anything he wanted me to do for him. “Give me your
blessings, sir,” he said, “so that I may have a longer life and
can complete at least one of your projects.”
The young man’s dedication moved me and I prayed for
his recovery all night. The Lord answered my prayers and
Tiwari was able to get back to work in a month. He did an
excellent job in helping to realise the Akash missile
airframe from scratch within the short space of three years.
He then took up the task of chronicling my story. Over the
last year, he patiently transcribed the bits and pieces of my
story and converted them into a fluent narrative. He also
went through my personal library meticulously and selected
from among the pieces of poetry those that I had marked
while reading, and included them in the text.
This story is an account, I hope, not just of my personal
triumphs and tribulations but of the successes and
setbacks of the science establishment in modern India,
struggling to establish itself in the technological forefront. It
is the story of national aspiration and of cooperative
endeavour. And, as I see it, the saga of India’s search for
scientific self-sufficiency and technological competence is
a parable for our times.
Each individual creature on this beautiful planet is
created by God to fulfil a particular role. Whatever I have
achieved in life is through His help, and an expression of
His will. He showered His grace on me through some
outstanding teachers and colleagues, and when I pay my
tributes to these fine persons, I am merely praising His
glory. All these rockets and missiles are His work through a
small person called Kalam, in order to tell the several-
million mass of India, to never feel small or helpless. We
are all born with a divine fire in us. Our efforts should be to
give wings to this fire and fill the world with the glow of its
goodness.
May God bless you!

ORIENTATION
[ 1931 – 1963 ]
This earth is His, to Him belong those vast and boundless
skies;Both seas within Him rest, and yet in that small pool
He lies.
ATHARVAVEDA Book 4, Hymn 16.
1
I
was born into a middle-class Tamil family in the island
town of Rameswaram in the erstwhile Madras state. My
father, Jainulabdeen, had neither much formal education
nor much wealth;
despite these disadvantages, he possessed great
innate wisdom and a true generosity of spirit. He had an
ideal helpmate in my mother, Ashiamma. I do not recall the
exact number of people she fed every day, but I am quite
certain that far more outsiders ate with us than all the
members of our own family put together.
My parents were widely regarded as an ideal couple.
My mother’s lineage was the more distinguished, one of
her forebears having been bestowed the title of ‘Bahadur’
by the British.
I was one of many children—a short boy with rather
undistinguished looks, born to tall and handsome parents.
We lived in our ancestral house, which was built in the
middle of the 19th century. It was a fairly large pucca house,
made of limestone and brick, on the Mosque Street in
Rameswaram. My austere father used to avoid all
inessential comforts and luxuries. However, all necessities
were provided for, in terms of food, medicine or clothes. In
fact, I would say mine was a very secure childhood, both
materially and emotionally.
I normally ate with my mother, sitting on the floor of the
kitchen. She would place a banana leaf before me, on
which she then ladled rice and aromatic sambhar, a variety
of sharp, home-made pickles and a dollop of fresh coconut
chutney.
The famous Shiva temple, which made Rameswaram
so sacred to pilgrims, was about a ten-minute walk from
our house. Our locality was predominantly Muslim, but there
were quite a few Hindu families too, living amicably with
their Muslim neighbours. There was a very old mosque in
our locality where my father would take me for evening
prayers. I had not the faintest idea of the meaning of the
Arabic prayers chanted, but I was totally convinced that they
reached God. When my father came out of the mosque
after the prayers, people of different religions would be
sitting outside, waiting for him. Many of them offered bowls
of water to my father who would dip his fingertips in them
and say a prayer. This water was then carried home for
invalids. I also remember people visiting our home to offer
thanks after being cured. My father always smiled and
asked them to thank Allah, the benevolent and merciful.
The high priest of Rameswaram temple, Pakshi
Lakshmana Sastry, was a very close friend of my father’s.
One of the most vivid memories of my early childhood is of
the two men, each in his traditional attire, discussing
spiritual matters. When I was old enough to ask questions, I
asked my father about the relevance of prayer. My father
told me there was nothing mysterious about prayer. Rather,
prayer made possible a communion of the spirit between
people. “When you pray,” he said, “you transcend your body
and become a part of the cosmos, which knows no division
of wealth, age, caste, or creed.”
My father could convey complex spiritual concepts in
very simple, downto-earth Tamil. He once told me, “In his
own time, in his own place, in what he really is, and in the
stage he has reached—good or bad—every human being
is a specific element within the whole of the manifest divine
Being. So why be afraid of difficulties, sufferings and
problems? When troubles come, try to understand the
relevance of your sufferings. Adversity always presents
opportunities for introspection.”
“Why don’t you say this to the people who come to you
for help and advice?” I asked my father. He put his hands
on my shoulders and looked straight into my eyes. For quite
some time he said nothing, as if he was judging my
capacity to comprehend his words. Then he answered in a
low, deep voice. His answer filled me with a strange energy
and enthusiasm:
Whenever human beings find themselves alone, as a
natural reaction, they start looking for company. Whenever
they are in trouble, they look for someone to help them.
Whenever they reach an impasse, they look to someone to
show them the way out. Every recurrent anguish, longing,
and desire finds its own special helper. For the people who
come to me in distress, I am but a go-between in their effort
to propitiate demonic forces with prayers and offerings.
This is not a correct approach at all and should never be
followed. One must understand the difference between a
fear-ridden vision of destiny and the vision that enables us
to seek the enemy of fulfilment within ourselves.
I remember my father starting his day at 4 a.m. by
reading the namaz before dawn. After the namaz, he used
to walk down to a small coconut grove we owned, about 4
miles from our home. He would return, with about a dozen
coconuts tied together thrown over his shoulder, and only
then would he have his breakfast. This remained his routine
even when he was in his late sixties.
I have throughout my life tried to emulate my father in my
own world of science and technology. I have endeavoured
to understand the fundamental truths revealed to me by my
father, and feel convinced that there exists a divine power
that can lift one up from confusion, misery, melancholy and
failure, and guide one to one’s true place. And once an
individual severs his emotional and physical bondage, he is
on the road to freedom, happiness and peace of mind.
I was about six years old when my father embarked on
the project of building a wooden sailboat to take pilgrims
from 
Rameswaram 
to 
Dhanuskodi, 
(also 
called
Sethukkarai), and back. He worked at building the boat on
the seashore, with the help of a relative, Ahmed Jallaluddin,
who later married my sister, Zohara. I watched the boat
take shape. The wooden hull and bulkheads were
seasoned with the heat from wood fires. My father was
doing good business with the boat when, one day, a
cyclone bringing winds of over 100 miles per hour carried
away our boat, along with some of the landmass of
Sethukkarai. The Pamban Bridge collapsed with a train full
of passengers on it. Until then, I had only seen the beauty of
the sea, now its uncontrollable energy came as a revelation
to me.
By the time the boat met its untimely end, Ahmed
Jallaluddin had become a close friend of mine, despite the
difference in our ages. He was about 15 years older than I
and used to call me Azad. We used to go for long walks
together every evening. As we started from Mosque Street
and made our way towards the sandy shores of the island,
Jallaluddin and I talked mainly of spiritual matters. The
atmosphere of Rameswaram, with its flocking pilgrims, was
conducive to such discussion. Our first halt would be at the
imposing temple of Lord Shiva. Circling around the temple
with the same reverence as any pilgrim from a distant part
of the country, we felt a flow of energy pass through us.
Jallaluddin would talk about God as if he had a working
partnership with Him. He would present all his doubts to
God as if He were standing nearby to dispose of them. I
would stare at Jallaluddin and then look towards the large
groups of pilgrims around the temple, taking holy dips in the
sea, performing rituals and reciting prayers with a sense of
respect towards the same Unknown, whom we treat as the
formless Almighty. I never doubted that the prayers in the
temple reached the same destination as the ones offered
in our mosque. I only wondered whether Jallaluddin had any
other special connection to God. Jallaluddin’s schooling
had been limited, principally because of his family’s
straitened circumstances. This may have been the reason
why he always encouraged me to excel in my studies and
enjoyed my success vicariously. Never did I find the
slightest trace of resentment in Jallaluddin for his
deprivation. Rather, he was always full of gratitude for
whatever life had chosen to give him.
Incidentally, at the time I speak of, he was the only
person on the entire island who could write English. He
wrote letters for almost anybody in need, be they letters of
application or otherwise. Nobody of my acquaintance,
either in my family or in the neighbourhood even had
Jallaluddin’s level of education or any links of consequence
with the outside world. Jallaluddin always spoke to me
about educated people, of scientific discoveries, of
contemporary literature, and of the achievements of
medical science. It was he who made me aware of a
“brave, new world” beyond our narrow confines.
In the humble environs of my boyhood, books were a
scarce commodity. By local standards, however, the
personal library of STR Manickam, a former ‘revolutionary’
or militant nationalist, was sizeable. He encouraged me to
read all I could and I often visited his home to borrow
books.
Another person who greatly influenced my boyhood was
my first cousin, Samsuddin. He was the sole distributor for
newspapers in Rameswaram. The newspapers would
arrive at Rameswaram station by the morning train from
Pamban. Samsuddin’s newspaper agency was a one-man
organization catering to the reading demands of the 1,000-
strong literate population of Rameswaram town. These
newspapers were mainly bought to keep abreast of current
developments in the National Independence Movement, for
astrological reference or to check the bullion rates
prevailing in Madras. A few readers with a more
cosmopolitan outlook would discuss Hitler, Mahatma
Gandhi and Jinnah; almost all would finally flow into the
mighty political current of Periyar EV Ramaswamy’s
movement against high caste Hindus. Dinamani was the
most sought after newspaper. Since reading the printed
matter was beyond my capability, I had to satisfy myself
with glancing at the pictures in the newspaper before
Samsuddin delivered them to his customers.
The Second World War broke out in 1939, when I was
eight years old. For reasons I have never been able to
understand, a sudden demand for tamarind seeds erupted
in the market. I used to collect the seeds and sell them to a
provision shop on Mosque Street. A day’s collection would
fetch me the princely sum of one anna. Jallaluddin would tell
me stories about the war which I would later attempt to
trace in the headlines in Dinamani. Our area, being
isolated, was completely unaffected by the war. But soon
India was forced to join the Allied Forces and something
like a state of emergency was declared. The first casualty
came in the form of the suspension of the train halt at
Rameswaram station. The newspapers now had to be
bundled and thrown out from the moving train on the
Rameswaram 
Road 
between 
Rameswaram 
and
Dhanuskodi. That forced Samsuddin to look for a helping
hand to catch the bundles and, as if naturally, I filled the slot.
Samsuddin helped me earn my first wages. Half a century
later, I can still feel the surge of pride in earning my own
money for the first time.
Every child is born, with some inherited characteristics,
into a specific socio-economic and emotional environment,
and trained in certain ways by figures of authority. I
inherited honesty and self-discipline from my father; from
my mother, I inherited faith in goodness and deep kindness
and so did my three brothers and sister. But it was the time
I spent with Jallaluddin and Samsuddin that perhaps
contributed most to the uniqueness of my childhood and
made all the difference in my later life. The unschooled
wisdom of Jallaluddin and Samsuddin was so intuitive and
responsive 
to 
non-verbal 
messages, 
that 
I 
can
unhesitatingly attribute my subsequently manifested
creativity to their company in my childhood.
I had three close friends in my childhood—Ramanadha
Sastry, Aravindan, and Sivaprakasan. All these boys were
from orthodox Hindu Brahmin families. As children, none of
us ever felt any difference amongst ourselves because of
our religious differences and upbringing. In fact,
Ramanadha Sastry was the son of Pakshi Lakshmana
Sastry, the high priest of the Rameswaram temple. Later,
he took over the priesthood of the Rameswaram temple
from his father; Aravindan went into the business of
arranging transport for visiting pilgrims; and Sivaprakasan
became a catering contractor for the Southern Railways.
During the annual Shri Sita Rama Kalyanam ceremony,
our family used to arrange boats with a special platform for
carrying idols of the Lord from the temple to the marriage
site, situated in the middle of the pond called Rama Tirtha
which was near our house. Events from the Ramayana and
from the life of the Prophet were the bedtime stories my
mother and grandmother would tell the children in our
family.
One day when I was in the fifth standard at the
Rameswaram Elementary School, a new teacher came to
our class. I used to wear a cap which marked me as a
Muslim, and I always sat in the front row next to Ramanadha
Sastry, who wore a sacred thread. The new teacher could
not stomach a Hindu priest’s son sitting with a Muslim boy.
In accordance with our social ranking as the new teacher
saw it, I was asked to go and sit on the back bench. I felt
very sad, and so did Ramanadha Sastry. He looked utterly
downcast as I shifted to my seat in the last row. The image
of him weeping when I shifted to the last row left a lasting
impression on me.
After school, we went home and told our respective
parents about the incident. Lakshmana Sastry summoned
the teacher, and in our presence, told the teacher that he
should not spread the poison of social inequality and
communal intolerance in the minds of innocent children. He
bluntly asked the teacher to either apologize or quit the
school and the island. Not only did the teacher regret his
behaviour, but the strong sense of conviction Lakshmana
Sastry conveyed ultimately reformed this young teacher.
On the whole, the small society of Rameswaram was
highly stratified and very rigid in terms of the segregation of
different social groups. However, my science teacher
Sivasubramania Iyer, though an orthodox Brahmin with a
very conservative wife, was something of a rebel. He did
his best to break social barriers so that people from varying
backgrounds could mingle easily. He used to spend hours
with me and would say, “Kalam, I want you to develop so
that you are on par with the highly educated people of the
big cities.”
One day, he invited me to his home for a meal. His wife
was horrified at the idea of a Muslim boy being invited to
dine in her ritually pure kitchen. She refused to serve me in
her kitchen. Sivasubramania Iyer was not perturbed, nor did
he get angry with his wife, but instead, served me with his
own hands and sat down beside me to eat his meal. His
wife watched us from behind the kitchen door. I wondered
whether she had observed any difference in the way I ate
rice, drank water or cleaned the floor after the meal. When I
was leaving his house, Sivasubramania Iyer invited me to
join him for dinner again the next weekend. Observing my
hesitation, he told me not to get upset, saying, “Once you
decide to change the system, such problems have to be
confronted.” When I visited his house the next week,
Sivasubramania Iyer’s wife took me inside her kitchen and
served me food with her own hands.
Then the Second World War was over and India’s
freedom was imminent. “Indians will build their own India,”
declared Gandhiji. The whole country was filled with an
unprecedented optimism. I asked my father’s permission to
leave Rameswaram and study at the district headquarters
in Ramanathapuram.
He told me as if thinking aloud, “Abul! I know you have
to go away to grow. Does the seagull not fly across the Sun,
alone and without a nest? You must forego your longing for
the land of your memories to move into the dwelling place
of your greater desires; our love will not bind you nor will our
needs hold you.” He quoted Khalil Gibran to my hesitant
mother, “Your children are not your children. They are the
sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself. They come
through you but not from you. You may give them your love
but not your thoughts. For they have their own thoughts.”
He took me and my three brothers to the mosque and
recited the prayer Al Fatiha from the Holy Qur’an. As he put
me on the train at Rameswaram station he said, “This
island may be housing your body but not your soul. Your
soul dwells in the house of tomorrow which none of us at
Rameswaram can visit, not even in our dreams. May God
bless you, my child!”
Samsuddin and Ahmed Jallaluddin travelled with me to
Ramanathapuram to enrol me in Schwartz High School,
and to arrange for my boarding there. Somehow, I did not
take to the new setting. The town of Ramanathapuram was
a thriving, factious town of some fifty thousand people, but
the coherence and harmony of Rameswaram was absent. I
missed my home and grabbed every opportunity to visit
Rameswaram. The pull of educational opportunities at
Ramanathapuram was not strong enough to nullify the
attraction of poli, a South Indian sweet my mother made. In
fact, she used to prepare twelve distinctly different varieties
of it, bringing out the flavour of every single ingredient used
in the best possible combinations.
Despite my homesickness, I was determined to come
to terms with the new environment because I knew my
father had invested great hopes in my success. My father
visualized me as a Collector in the making and I thought it
my duty to realise my father’s dream, although I desperately
missed 
the 
familiarity, 
security 
and 
comforts 
of
Rameswaram.
Jallaluddin used to speak to me about the power of
positive thinking and I often recalled his words when I felt
homesick or dejected. I tried hard to do as he said, which
was to strive to control my thoughts and my mind and,
through these, to influence my destiny. Ironically, that
destiny did not lead me back to Rameswaram, but rather,
swept me farther away from the home of my childhood.

O
nce I settled down at the Schwartz High School,
Ramanathapuram, the enthusiastic fifteen-year-old within
me re-emerged. My teacher, Iyadurai Solomon, was an
ideal
guide for an eager young mind that was yet uncertain of
the possibilities and alternatives that lay before it. He made
his students feel very comfortable in class with his warm
and open-minded attitude. He used to say that a good
student could learn more from a bad teacher than a poor
student from even a skilled teacher.
During my stay at Ramanathapuram, my relationship
with him grew beyond that of teacher and pupil. In his
company, I learnt that one could exercise enormous
influence over the events of one’s own life. Iyadurai
Solomon used to say, “To succeed in life and achieve
results, you must understand and master three mighty
forces— desire, belief, and expectation.” Iyadurai Solomon,
who later became a Reverend, taught me that before
anything I wanted could happen, I had to desire it intensely
and be absolutely certain it would happen. To take an
example from my own life, I had been fascinated by the
mysteries of the sky and the flight of birds from early
childhood. I used to watch cranes and seagulls soar into
flight and longed to fly. Simple, provincial boy though I was, I
was convinced that one day I, too, would soar up into the
skies. Indeed, I was the first child from Rameswaram to fly.
Iyadurai Solomon was a great teacher because he
instilled in all the children a sense of their own worth.
Solomon raised my self-esteem to a high point and
convinced me, the son of parents who had not had the
benefits of education, that I too could aspire to become
whatever I wished. “With faith, you can change your
destiny,” he would say.
One day, when I was in the fourth form, my mathematics
teacher, Ramakrishna Iyer, was teaching another class.
Inadvertently, I wandered into that classroom and in the
manner of an old-fashioned despot, Ramakrishna Iyer
caught me by the neck and caned me in front of the whole
class. Many months later, when I scored full marks in
mathematics, he narrated the incident to the entire school
at morning assembly. “Whomsoever I cane becomes a
great man! Take my word, this boy is going to bring glory to
his school and to his teachers.” His praise quite made up
for the earlier humiliation!
By the time I completed my education at Schwartz, I was
a selfconfident boy determined to succeed. The decision to
go in for further education was taken without a second
thought. To us, in those days, the awareness of the
possibilities for a professional education did not exist;
higher education simply meant going to college. The
nearest 
college 
was 
at 
Tiruchchirappalli, 
spelled
Trichinopoly those days, and called Trichi for short.
In 1950, I arrived at St. Joseph’s College, Trichi, to
study for the Intermediate examination. I was not a bright
student in terms of examination grades but, thanks to my
two buddies back in Rameswaram, I had acquired a
practical bent of mind.
Whenever I returned to Rameswaram from Schwartz,
my elder brother Mustafa Kamal, who ran a provision store
on the railway station road, would call me in to give him a
little help and then vanish for hours together leaving the
shop in my charge. I sold oil, onions, rice and everything
else. The fastest moving items, I found, were cigarettes and
bidis. I used to wonder what made poor people smoke
away their hardearned money. When spared by Mustafa, I
would be put in charge of his kiosk by my younger brother,
Kasim Mohammed. There I sold novelties made of
seashells.
At St. Joseph’s, I was lucky to find a teacher like the
Rev. Father TN Sequeira. He taught us English and was
also our hostel warden. We were about a hundred boys
living in the three-storeyed hostel building. Rev. Father
used to visit each boy every night with a Bible in his hand.
His energy and patience was amazing. He was a very
considerate person who took care of even the most minute
requirements of his students. On Deepavali, on his
instructions, the Brother in charge of the hostel and the
mess volunteers would visit each room and distribute good
gingelly oil for the ritual bath.
I stayed on the St. Joseph’s campus for four years and
shared my room with two others. One was an orthodox
Iyengar from Srirangam and the other a Syrian Christian
from Kerala. The three of us had a wonderful time together.
When I was made secretary of the vegetarian mess during
my third year in the hostel, we invited the Rector, Rev.
Father Kalathil, over for lunch one Sunday. Our menu
included the choicest preparations from our diverse
backgrounds. The result was rather unexpected, but Rev.
Father was lavish in his praise of our efforts. We enjoyed
every moment with Rev. Father Kalathil, who participated in
our unsophisticated conversation with childlike enthusiasm.
It was a memorable event for us all.
My teachers at St. Joseph were the true followers of
Kanchi Paramacharya, who evoked people to “enjoy the
action of giving”. The vivid memory of our mathematics
teachers, Prof. Thothathri Iyengar and Prof. Suryanarayana
Sastry, walking together on the campus inspires me to this
day.
When I was in the final year at St. Joseph’s, I acquired a
taste for English literature. I began to read the great
classics, Tolstoy, Scott and Hardy being special favourites
despite their exotic settings, and then I moved on to some
works in Philosophy. It was around this time that I
developed a great interest in Physics.
The lessons on subatomic physics at St. Joseph’s by
my physics teachers, Prof. Chinna Durai and Prof.
Krishnamurthy, introduced me to the concept of the half-life
period and matters related to the radioactive decay of
substances. Sivasubramania Iyer, my science teacher at
Rameswaram, had never taught me that most subatomic
particles are unstable and that they disintegrate after a
certain time into other particles. All this I was learning for
the first time. But when he taught me to strive with diligence
because decay is inherent in all compounded things, was
he not talking of the same thing? I wonder why some
people tend to see science as something which takes man
away from God. As I look at it, the path of science can
always wind through the heart. For me, science has always
been the path to spiritual enrichment and self-realisation.
Even the rational thought-matrices of science have
been home to fairy tales. I am an avid reader of books on
cosmology and enjoy reading about celestial bodies. Many
friends, while asking me questions related to space flights,
sometimes slip into astrology. Quite honestly, I have never
really understood the reason behind the great importance
attached by people to the faraway planets in our solar
system. As an art, I have nothing against astrology, but if it
seeks acceptance under the guise of science, I reject it. I
do not know how these myths evolved about planets, star
constellations, and even satellites—that they can exercise
power on human beings. The highly complicated
calculations manipulated around the precise movements of
celestial bodies, to derive highly subjective conclusions
appear illogical to me. As I see it, the Earth is the most
powerful and energetic planet. As John Milton puts it so
beautifully in Paradise Lost, Book VIII:
. . . What if the Sun
Be centre to the World, and other stars . . . . .
The planet earth, so steadfast though she seem,
In sensibly three different motions move?
Wherever you go on this planet, there is movement and
life. Even apparently inanimate things like rocks, metal,
timber, clay are full of intrinsic movement—with electrons
dancing around each nucleus. This motion originates in
their response to the confinement imposed on them by the
nucleus, by means of electric forces which try to hold them
as close as possible. Electrons, just like any individual with
a certain amount of energy, detest confinement. The tighter
the electrons are held by the nucleus, the higher their orbital
velocity will be: in fact, the confinement of electrons in an
atom results in enormous velocities of about 1000 km per
second! These high velocities make the atom appear a
rigid sphere, just as a fast-moving fan appears like a disc. It
is very difficult to compress atoms more strongly—thus
giving matter its familiar solid aspect. Everything solid,
thus, contains much empty space within and everything
stationary contains great movement within. It is as though
the great dance of Shiva is being performed on earth
during every moment of our existence.
When I joined the B.Sc. degree course at St.Joseph’s, I
was unaware of any other option for higher education. Nor
did I have any information about career opportunities
available to a student of science. Only after obtaining a
B.Sc. did I realise that physics was not my subject. I had to
go into engineering to realise my dreams. I could have
joined the Engineering course long ago, right after finishing
my Intermediate course. Better late than never, I told myself
as I made the detour, applying for admission into the
Madras Institute of Technology (MIT), regarded as the
crown jewel of technical education in South India at that
time.
I managed to be on the list of selected candidates, but
admission to this prestigious institution was an expensive
affair. Around a thousand rupees was required, and my
father could not spare that much money. At that time, my
sister, Zohara, stood behind me, mortgaging her gold
bangles and chain. I was deeply touched by her
determination to see me educated and by her faith in my
abilities. I vowed to release her bangles from mortgage
with my own earnings. The only way before me to earn
money at that point of time was to study hard and get a
scholarship. I went ahead at full steam.
What fascinated me most at MIT was the sight of two
decommissioned 
aircraft 
displayed 
there 
for 
the
demonstration of the various subsystems of flying
machines. I felt a strange attraction towards them, and
would sit near them long after other students had gone
back to the hostel, admiring man’s will to fly free in the sky,
like a bird. After completing my first year, when I had to opt
for a specific branch, I almost spontaneously chose
aeronautical engineering. The goal was very clear in my
mind now; I was going to fly aircraft. I was convinced of this,
despite being aware of my lack of assertiveness, which
probably came about because of my humble background.
Around this time, I made special efforts to try and
communicate with different kinds of people. There were
setbacks, disappointments and distractions, but my father’s
inspiring words anchored me in those periods of nebulous
drift.

Plate 8 My teachers at Schwartz High School—
Iyadurai Solomon (standing, left) and Ramakrishna
Iyer (sitting, right). They are the best examples of
small-town Indian teachers committed to nurturing
talent.
“He who knows others is learned, but the wise one is the
one who knows himself. Learning without wisdom is of no
use.”
In the course of my education at MIT, three teachers
shaped my thinking. Their combined contributions formed
the foundation on which I later built my professional career.
These three teachers were Prof. Sponder, Prof. KAV
Pandalai and Prof. Narasingha Rao. Each one of them had
very distinct personalities, but they shared a common
impulse— the capacity to feed their students’ intellectual
hunger by sheer brilliance and untiring zeal.
Prof. Sponder taught me technical aerodynamics. He
was an Austrian with rich practical experience in
aeronautical engineering. During the Second World War,
he had been captured by the Nazis and imprisoned in a
concentration camp. Understandably, he had developed a
very strong dislike for Germans. Inciden- tally, the
aeronautical department was headed by a German, Prof.
Walter Repenthin. Another well-known professor, Dr Kurt
Tank, was a distinguished aeronautical engineer who had
designed the German Focke–Wulf FW 190 single-seater
fighter plane, an outstanding combat aircraft of the Second
World War. Dr Tank later joined the Hindustan Aeronautics
Limited (HAL) in Bangalore and was responsible for the
design of India’s first jet fighter, the HF-24 Marut.
Notwithstanding 
these 
irritants, 
Prof. 
Sponder
preserved 
his 
individuality 
and 
maintained 
high
professional standards. He was always calm, energetic
and in total control of himself. He kept abreast of the latest
technologies and expected his students to do the same. I
consulted him before opting for aeronautical engineering.
He told me that one should never worry about one’s future
prospects: instead, it was more important to lay sound
foundations, to have sufficient enthusiasm and an
accompanying passion for one’s chosen field of study. The
trouble with Indians, Prof. Sponder used to observe, was
not that they lacked educational opportunities or industrial
infrastructure—the trouble was in their failure to
discriminate between disciplines and to rationalise their
choices. Why aeronautics? Why not electrical engineering?
Why not mechanical engineering? I myself would like to tell
all novitiate engineering students that when they choose
their specialization, the essential point to consider is
whether the choice articulates their inner feelings and
aspirations.
Prof. KAV Pandalai taught me aero-structure design
and analysis. He was a cheerful, friendly and enthusiastic
teacher, who brought a fresh approach to every year’s
teaching course. It was Professor Pandalai who opened up
the secrets of structural engineering to us. Even today I
believe that everyone who has been taught by Prof.
Pandalai would agree that he was a man of great
intellectual integrity and scholarship—but with no trace of
arrogance. His students were free to disagree with him on
several points in the classroom.
Prof. Narasingha Rao was a mathematician, who taught
us theoretical aerodynamics. I still remember his method of
teaching fluid dynamics. After attending his classes, I
began to prefer mathematical physics to any other subject.
Often, I have been told I carry a “surgical knife” to
aeronautical design reviews. If it had not been for Prof.
Rao’s kind and persistent advice on picking up proofs to
equations of aerodynamic flow, I would not have acquired
this metaphorical tool.
Aeronautics is a fascinating subject, containing within it
the promise of freedom. The great difference between
freedom and escape, between motion and movement,
between slide and flow are the secrets of this science. My
teachers revealed these truths to me. Through their
meticulous teaching, they created within me an excitement
about aeronautics. Their intellectual fervour, clarity of
thought and passion for perfection helped me to launch into
a serious study of fluid dynamicsmodes of compressible
medium motion, development of shock waves and shock,
induced flow separation at increasing speeds, shock stall
and shock-wave drag.
Slowly, a great amalgamation of information took place
in my mind. The structural features of aeroplanes began to
gain new meanings— biplanes, monoplanes, tailless
planes, canard configured planes, deltawing planes, all
these began to assume increasing significance for me. The
three teachers, all of them authorities in their different fields,
helped me to mould a composite knowledge.
My third and last year at MIT was a year of transition
and was to have a great impact on my later life. In those
days, a new climate of political enlightenment and industrial
effort was sweeping across the country. I had to test my
belief in God and see if it could fit into the matrix of
scientific thinking. The accepted view was that a belief in
scientific methods was the only valid approach to
knowledge. If so, I wondered, was matter alone the ultimate
reality and were spiritual phenomena but a manifestation of
matter? Were all ethical values relative, and was sensory
perception the only source of knowledge and truth? I
wondered about these issues, attempting to sort out the
wondered about these issues, attempting to sort out the
vexing question of “scientific temper” and my own spiritual
interests. The value system in which I had been nurtured
was profoundly religious. I had been taught that true reality
lay beyond the material world in the spiritual realm, and that
knowledge could be obtained only through inner
experience.
Meanwhile, when I had finished my course work, I was
assigned a project to design a low-level attack aircraft
together with four other colleagues. I had taken up the
responsibility of preparing and drawing the aerodynamic
design. My team mates distributed among themselves the
tasks of designing the propulsion, structure, control and
instrumentation of the aircraft. One day, my design teacher,
Prof. Srinivasan, then the Director of the MIT, reviewed my
progress and declared it dismal and disappointing. I
offered a dozen excuses for the delay, but none of them
impressed Prof. Srinivasan. I finally pleaded for a month’s
time to complete the task. The Professor looked at me for
some time and said, “Look, young man, today is Friday
afternoon. I give you three days’ time. If by Monday morning
I don’t get the configuration drawing, your scholarship will
be stopped.” I was dumbstruck. The scholarship was my
lifeline and I would be quite helpless if it was withdrawn. I
could see no other way out but to finish the task as I had
been instructed. That night, I remained at the drawing
board, skipping dinner. Next morning, I took only an hour’s
break to freshen up and eat a little food. On Sunday
morning, I was very near completion, when suddenly I felt
someone else’s presence in the room. Prof. Srinivasan
was watching me from a distance. Coming straight from the
gymkhana, he was still in his tennis outfit and had dropped
in to see my progress. After examining my work, Prof.
Srinivasan hugged me affectionately and patted my back in
appreciation. He said, “I knew I was putting you under
stress and asking you to meet an impossible deadline. I
never expected you to perform so well.”
During the rest of the period of the project, I participated
in an essay competition organized by the MIT Tamil
Sangam (Literary Society). Tamil is my mother tongue and I
am proud of its origins, which have been traced back to
Sage Agastya in the pre-Ramayana period; its literature
dates back to the fifth century BC. It is said to be a
language moulded by lawyers and grammarians and is
internationally acclaimed for its clear-cut logic. I was very
enthusiastic about ensuring that science did not remain
outside the purview of this wonderful language. I wrote an
article entitled “Let Us Make Our Own Aircraft” in Tamil. The
article evoked much interest and I won the competition,
taking the first prize from ‘Devan’, the editor of the popular
Tamil weekly, Ananda Vikatan.
My most touching memory of MIT is related to Prof.
Sponder. We were posing for a group photograph as part
of a farewell ritual. All the graduating students had lined up
in three rows with the professors seated in the front.
Suddenly, Prof. Sponder got up and looked for me. I was
standing in the third row. “Come and sit with me in the
front,” he said. I was taken aback by Prof. Sponder’s
invitation. “You are my best student and hard work will help
you bring a great name for your teachers in future.”
Embarrassed by the praise but honoured by the
recognition, I sat with Prof. Sponder for the photograph.
“Let God be your hope, your stay, your guide and provide
the lantern for your feet in your journey into the future,” said
the introverted genius, bidding me adieu.
From MIT, I went to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited
(HAL) at Bangalore as a trainee. There I worked on engine
overhauling as part of a team. Hands-on work on aircraft
engine overhauling was very educative. When a principle
learnt in the classroom is borne out by practical experience,
it creates a strange sense of excitement—akin to
unexpectedly running into an old friend among a crowd of
strangers. At HAL, I worked on the overhauling of both
piston and turbine engines. The hazy concepts of gas
dynamics and diffusion processes in the working principle
of after burning came into sharper focus in my mind. I was
also trained in radial engine-cum-drum operations.
I learned how to check a crankshaft for wear and tear,
and a connecting rod and crankshaft for twist. I did
calibrations of a fixedpitch fan fitted to a super-charged
engine. I opened up pressure and acceleration-cum-speed
control systems, and air starter supply systems of turbo-
engines. Getting to understand feathering, un-feathering
and reversing of propeller engines was very interesting.
The demonstration of the delicate art of beta (blade angle
control) by HAL technicians still lingers in my memory. They
had neither studied in major universities, nor were they
merely implementing what their engineer-in-charge was
suggesting. They had been working hands-on for years and
this had given them something like an intuitive feel for the
work.
Two alternative opportunities for employment, both
close to my longstanding dream of flying, presented
themselves before me when I came out of HAL as a
graduate aeronautical engineer. One was a career in the
Air Force and another was a job at the Directorate of
Technical Development and Production, DTD&P(Air), at
the Ministry of Defence. I applied for both. The interview
calls arrived from both the places almost simultaneously. I
was asked to reach Dehra Dun by the Air Force
recruitment authorities and Delhi by DTD&P(Air). The boy
from the Coromandel Coast took a train to the North of
India. My destination was more than 2000 km away, and
was to be my first encounter with the vastness of my
motherland.
* * *

T
hrough the window of the compartment, I watched the
countryside slip past. From a distance, the men in the fields
in their white dhotis and turbans, and the womenfolk in
bright
splashes of colour against the green background of
paddy fields, seemed to inhabit some beautiful painting. I
sat glued to the window. Almost everywhere, people were
engaged in some activity which had a rhythm and
tranquillity about it—men driving cattle, women fetching
water from streams. Occasionally, a child would appear
and wave at the train.
It is astonishing how the landscape changes as one
moves northwards. The rich and fertile plains of the river
Ganga and its numerous tributaries have invited invasion,
turmoil, and change. Around 1500 BC, fair-skinned Aryans
swept in through the mountain passes from the far north-
west. The tenth century brought Muslims, who later mingled
with the local people and became an integral part of this
country. One empire gave way to another. Religious
conquests continued. All this time, the part of India south of
the Tropic of Cancer remained largely untouched, safe
behind the shield of the Vindhya and Satpura mountain
ranges. The Narmada, Tapti, Mahanadi, Godavari, and
Krishna rivers had woven a net of almost unassailable
protection for the tapering Indian peninsula. To bring me to
Delhi, my train had crossed all these geographical
impediments through the power of scientific advancement.
I halted for a week in Delhi, the city of the great Sufi
Saint Hazrat Nizamuddin, and appeared for the interview at
DTD&P(Air). I did well at the interview. The questions were
of a routine nature, and did not challenge my knowledge of
the subject. Then I proceeded to Dehra Dun for my
interview at the Air Force Selection Board. At the Selection
Board, the emphasis was more on “personality” than on
intelligence. Perhaps they were looking for physical fitness
and an articulate manner. I was excited but nervous,
determined but anxious, confident but tense. I could only
finish ninth in the batch of 25 examined to select eight
officers for commissioning in the Air Force. I was deeply
disappointed. It took me some time to comprehend that the
opportunity to join the Air Force had just slipped through my
fingers. I dragged myself out of the Selection Board and
stood at the edge of a cliff. There was a lake far below. I
knew that the days ahead would be difficult. There were
questions to be answered and a plan of action to be
prepared. I trekked down to Rishikesh.
I bathed in the Ganga and revelled in the purity of its
water. Then, I walked to the Sivananda Ashram situated a
little way up the hill. I could feel intense vibrations when I
entered. I saw a large number of sadhus seated all around
in a state of trance. I had read that sadhus were psychic
people—people who know things intuitively and, in my
dejected mood, I sought answers to the doubts that
troubled me.
I met Swami Sivananda—a man who looked like a
Buddha, wearing a snow-white dhoti and wooden slippers.
He had an olive complexion and black, piercing eyes. I was
struck by his irresistible, almost childlike smile and
gracious manner. I introduced myself to the Swamiji. My
Muslim name aroused no reaction in him. Before I could
speak any further, he inquired about the source of my
sorrow. He offered no explanation of how he knew that I
was sad and I did not ask.
I told him about my unsuccessful attempt to join the
Indian Air Force and my long-cherished desire to fly. He
smiled, washing away all my anxiety almost instantly. Then
he said in a feeble, but very deep voice,
Desire, when it stems from the heart and spirit, when it
is pure and intense, possesses awesome electromagnetic
energy. This energy is released into the ether each night,
as the mind falls into the sleep state. Each morning it
returns to the conscious state reinforced with the cosmic
currents. That which has been imaged will surely and
certainly be manifested. You can rely, young man, upon this
ageless promise as surely as you can rely upon the
eternally unbroken promise of sunrise... and of Spring.
When the student is ready, the teacher will appear—
How true! Here was the teacher to show the way to a
student who had nearly gone astray! “Accept your destiny
and go ahead with your life. You are not destined to
become an Air Force pilot. What you are destined to
become is not revealed now but it is predetermined. Forget
this failure, as it was essential to lead you to your destined
path. Search, instead, for the true purpose of your
existence. Become one with yourself, my son! Surrender
yourself to the wish of God,” Swamiji said.
I returned to Delhi and enquired at the DTD&P(Air)
about the outcome of my interview. In response, I was
handed my appointment letter. I joined the next day as
Senior Scientific Assistant on a basic salary of Rs 250/-
per month. If this was to be my destiny, I thought, let it be so.
Finally, I was filled with mental peace. No more did I feel
any bitterness or resentment at my failure to enter the Air
Force. All this was in 1958.
At the Directorate, I was posted at the Technical Centre
(Civil Aviation). If I was not flying aeroplanes, I was at least
helping to make them airworthy. During my first year in the
Directorate, I carried out a design assignment on
supersonic target aircraft with the help of the officer-in-
charge, R Varadharajan, and won a word of praise from the
Director, Dr Neelakantan. To gain shop-floor exposure to
aircraft maintenance, I was sent to the Aircraft and
Armament Testing Unit (A&ATU) at Kanpur. At that time,
they were involved in a tropical evaluation of Gnat Mk I
aircraft. I participated in the performance assessment of its
operation systems.
Even in those days, Kanpur was a very populous city. It
was my first experience of living in an industrial town. The
cold weather, crowds, noise and smoke were in total
contrast to what I was used to in Rameswaram. I was
particularly troubled by the ubiquitous presence of potatoes
on the dining table, right from breakfast to dinner. To me, it
seemed that a feeling of loneliness pervaded the city. The
people on the streets had all come from their villages in
search of jobs in factories, leaving behind the smell of their
soil and the protection of their families.
On my return to Delhi, I was informed that the design of
a DART target had been taken up at the DTD&P (Air) and
that I had been included in the design team. I completed
this task with the other team members. Then, I undertook a
preliminary design study on a Human Centrifuge. I later
carried out the design and development of a Vertical
Takeoff and Landing Platform. I was also associated with
the development and construction of the Hot Cockpit. Three
years passed. Then the Aeronautical Development
Establishment (ADE) was born in Bangalore and I was
posted to the new establishment.
Bangalore as a city was in direct contrast to Kanpur. In
fact, I feel our country has an uncanny way of bringing out
extremes in her people. I suppose, it is because Indians
have been both afflicted and enriched by centuries of
migrations. Loyalty to different rulers has dulled our
capacity for a single allegiance. Instead, we have
developed an extraordinary ability to be compassionate
and cruel, sensitive and callous, deep and fickle, all at the
same time. To the untrained eye, we may appear colourful
and picturesque; to the critical eye, we are but shoddy
imitations of our various masters. In Kanpur, I saw paan-
chewing imitations of Wajid Ali Shah, and in Bangalore it
was replaced by dog-walking sahibs. Here too, I longed for
the depth and calmness of Rameswaram. The relationship
between the heart and the head of an earthy Indian has
been eroded by the divided sensibilities of our cities. I
spent my evenings exploring the gardens and shopping
plazas of Bangalore.
The workload at ADE during the first year of its
inception was quite light. In fact, I had to generate work for
myself at first, until the tempo gradually built up. Based on
my preliminary studies on ground-handling equipment, a
project team was formed to design and develop an
indigenous hovercraft prototype as a ground equipment
machine (GEM). The team was a small working group,
comprising four persons at the level of Scientific Assistant.
Dr OP Mediratta, Director of the ADE, asked me to lead
the team. We were given three years to launch the
engineering model.
The project was, by any standards, bigger than our
collective capabilities. None of us had any experience in
building a machine, let alone a flying machine. There were
no designs or standard components available to begin
with. All we knew was that we had to make a successful
heavier-than-air flying machine. We tried to read as much
literature as we could find on hovercrafts, but there was not
much available. We tried to consult people knowledgeable
in this area, but could find none. One day, I simply took the
decision to proceed with the limited information and
resources available.
This endeavour to produce a wingless, light, swift
machine opened the windows of my mind. I was quick to
see at least a metaphorical connection between a
hovercraft and an aircraft. After all, the Wright Brothers
made the first aeroplane after fixing bicycles for seven
years! I saw in the GEM project great opportunities for
ingenuity and growth. We went straight into hardware
development after spending a few months on the drawing
board.
There is always the danger that a person with my kind of
background— rural or small-town, middle-class, whose
parents had limited education— will retreat into a corner
and remain there struggling for bare existence, unless
some great turn of circumstance propels him into a more
favourable environment. I knew I had to create my own
opportunities.
Part by part, subsystem by subsystem, stage by stage,
things started moving. Working on this project, I learned
that once your mind stretches to a new level it never goes
back to its original dimension.
At that time VK Krishna Menon was the Defence
Minister. He was keenly interested in the progress of our
small project, which he envisioned as the beginning of the
indigenous development of India’s defence equipment.
Whenever he was in Bangalore, he always found some
time to review the progress of our project. His confidence in
our ability ignited our enthusiasm. I would enter the
assembly shop leaving my other problems outside, just as
my father used to enter the mosque for prayer, leaving his
shoes outside.
But not everyone accepted Krishna Menon’s opinion
about GEM. Our experiments with the available parts and
components did not exactly delight my senior colleagues.
Many even called us a group of eccentric inventors in
pursuit of an impossible dream. I, being the leader of the
“navvies”, was a particularly inviting target. I was regarded
as yet another country bumpkin who believed that riding the
air was his domain. The weight of opinion against us
buttressed my ever-optimistic mind. The comments of
some of the senior scientists at ADE made me recall John
Trowbridge’s famous satirical poem on the Wright
Brothers, published in 1896:
. . . . with thimble and thread
And wax and hammer, and buckles and screws,
And all such things as geniuses use; —
Two bats for patterns, curious fellows!
A charcoal-pot and a pair of bellows.
When the project was about a year old, Defence
Minister Krishna Menon made one of his routine visits to
ADE. I escorted him into our assembly shop. Inside, on a
table lay the GEM model broken down into sub-
assemblies. The model represented the culmination of one
year’s untiring efforts to develop a practical hovercraft for
battlefield applications. The minister fired one question
after another at me, determined to ensure that the prototype
would go into test flight within the coming year. He told Dr
Mediratta, “GEM flight is possible with the gadgets Kalam
now possesses”.
The hovercraft was christened Nandi, after the bull
ridden by Lord Shiva. For a prototype, its form, fit and finish
was beyond our expectation, given the rudimentary
infrastructure we possessed. I told my colleagues, “Here is
a flying machine, not constructed by a bunch of cranks but
by engineers of ability. Don’t look at it—it is not made to
look at, but to fly with.”
Defence Minister Krishna Menon flew in the Nandi,
overruling the accompanying officials’ concern for his
safety. A Group Captain in the minister’s troupe, who had
logged in many thousands of flying hours, even offered to fly
the machine to save the minister from the potential danger
of flying with an inexperienced civilian pilot like myself and
gestured to me to come out of the machine. I was sure
about my competence in flying the machine I had made,
and therefore shook my head in negation. Observing this
wordless communication, Krishna Menon dismissed the
insulting suggestion of the Group Captain with a laugh and
signalled to me to start the machine. He was very happy.
“You have demonstrated that the basic problems of
hovercraft development are solved. Go for a more powerful
prime mover and call me for a second ride,” Krishna Menon
told me. The skeptical Group Captain (now Air Marshal)
Golay, later became a good friend of mine.
We completed the project ahead of schedule. We had a
working hovercraft with us, moving on an air cushion of
about 40mm with a load of 550kg, including the tare weight.
Dr Mediratta was visibly pleased with the achievement. But
by this time, Krishna Menon was out of office and could not
take his promised second ride. In the new order, not many
people shared his dream with regard to military
applications of an indigenous hovercraft. In fact, even
today, we import hovercrafts. The project was mired in
controversies and was finally shelved. It was a new
experience for me. So far, I had believed that the sky was
the limit, but now it appeared that the limits were much
closer. There are boundaries that dictate life: you can only
lift so much weight; you can only learn so fast; you can only
work so hard; you can only go so far!
I was unwilling to face reality. I had put my heart and soul
into Nandi. That it would not be used was something
beyond my comprehension. I was disappointed and
disillusioned. In this period of confusion and uncertainty,
memories from my childhood came back to me and I
discovered new meanings in them.
Pakshi Sastry used to say, “Seek the truth, and the truth
shall set you free.” As the Bible says, “Ask and you shall
receive.” It did not happen immediately, but it happened
nevertheless. One day, Dr Mediratta called me. He inquired
about the state of our hovercraft. When told that it was in
perfect condition to be flown, he asked me to organize a
demonstration for an important visitor the next day. No VIP
was scheduled to visit the laboratory during the next week
as far as I knew. However, I communicated Dr Mediratta’s
instructions to my colleagues and we felt a new surge of
hope.
The next day Dr Mediratta brought a visitor to our
hovercraft—a tall, handsome, bearded man. He asked me
several questions about the machine. I was struck by the
objectivity and clarity of his thinking. “Can you give me a
ride in the machine?” he enquired. His request filled me
with joy. Finally, here was someone who was interested in
my work.
We took a ten-minute ride in the hovercraft, a few
centimetres above the ground. We were not flying, but were
definitely floating in the air. The visitor asked me a few
questions about myself, thanked me for the ride and
departed. But not before introducing himself—he was Prof.
MGK Menon, Director of the Tata Institute of Fundamental
Research (TIFR). After a week, I received a call from the
Indian Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR), to
attend an interview for the post of Rocket Engineer. All I
knew about INCOSPAR at that time was that it was formed
out of the TIFR talent pool at Bombay (now Mumbai) to
organize space research in India.
I went to Bombay to attend the interview. I was unsure
about the type of questions I would have to face at the
interview. There was hardly any time to read up or talk to
any experienced person. Lakshmana Sastry’s voice
quoting from the Bhagawad Gita echoed in my ears:
All beings are born to delusion . . . overcome by the
dualities which arise from wish and hate . . . . But those
men of virtuous deeds in whom sin has come to an end,
freed from the delusion of dualities, worship Me steadfast
in their vows.
I reminded myself that the best way to win was to not
need to win. The best performances are accomplished
when you are relaxed and free of doubt. I decided to take
things as they came. Since neither Prof. MGK Menon’s visit
nor the call for an interview had been of my making, I
decided this was the best attitude to take.
I was interviewed by Dr Vikram Sarabhai along with
Prof. MGK Menon and Mr Saraf, then the Deputy Secretary
of the Atomic Energy Commission. As I entered the room, I
sensed their warmth and friendliness. I was almost
immediately struck by Dr Sarabhai’s warmth. There was
none of the arrogance or the patronising attitudes which
interviewers usually display when talking to a young and
vulnerable candidate. Dr Sarabhai’s questions did not
probe my existing knowledge or skills; rather they were an
exploration of the possibilities I was filled with. He was
looking at me as if in reference to a larger whole. The entire
encounter seemed to me a total moment of truth, in which
my dream was enveloped by the larger dream of a bigger
person.
I was advised to stay back for a couple of days.
However, the next evening I was told about my selection. I
was to be absorbed as a rocket engineer at INCOSPAR.
This was a breakthrough a young man like myself dreamed
of.
My 
work 
at 
INCOSPAR 
commenced 
with 
a
familiarization course at the TIFR Computer Centre. The
atmosphere here was remarkably different from that at
DTD&P (AIR). Labels mattered very little. There was no
need for anyone to justify his position or to be at the
receiving end of the others’ hostility.
Some time in the latter half of 1962, INCOSPAR took
the decision to set up the Equatorial Rocket Launching
Station at Thumba, a sleepy fishing village near Trivandrum
(now Thiruvananthapuram) in Kerala. Dr Chitnis of the
Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad had spotted it
as a suitable location as it was very close to the earth’s
magnetic equator. This was the quiet beginning of modern
rocket-based research in India. The site selected at
Thumba lay between the railway line and the sea coast,
covering a distance of about two and a half km and
measuring about 600 acres. Within this area, stood a large
church, whose site had to be acquired. Land acquisition
from private parties is always a difficult and time-
consuming process, especially in densely populated places
like Kerala. In addition, there was the delicate matter of
acquiring a site of religious significance. The Collector of
Trivandrum then, K Madhavan Nair, executed this task in a
most tactful, peaceful and expeditious manner, with the
blessings and cooperation of Right Rev. Dr Dereira, who
was the Bishop of Trivandrum in 1962. Soon RD John, the
executive engineer of the Central Public Works Department
(CPWD), had transformed the entire area. The St. Mary
Magdalene church housed the first office of the Thumba
Space Centre. The prayer room was my first laboratory, the
Bishop’s room was my design and drawing office. To this
day, the church is maintained in its full glory and, at present,
houses the Indian Space Museum.
Very soon after this, I was asked to proceed to America
for a sixmonth training programme on sounding rocket
launching techniques, at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) work centres. I took some
time off before going abroad and went to Rameswaram.
My father was very pleased to learn about the opportunity
that had come my way. He took me to the mosque and
organized a special namaz in thanksgiving. I could feel the
power of God flowing in a circuit through my father to me
and back to God; we were all under the spell of the prayer.
One of the important functions of prayer, I believe, is to
act as a stimulus to creative ideas. Within the mind are all
the resources required for successful living. Ideas are
present in the consciousness, which when released and
given scope to grow and take shape, can lead to
successful events. God, our Creator, has stored within our
minds and personalities, great potential strength and
ability. Prayer helps us to tap and develop these powers.
Ahmed Jallaluddin and Samsuddin came to see me off
at Bombay airport. It was their first exposure to a big city
like Bombay, just as I myself was about to have my first
exposure to a mega city like New York. Jallaluddin and
Samsuddin were self-reliant, positive, optimistic men who
undertook their work with the assurance of success. It is
from these two persons that I drew the core creative power
of my mind. My sentiments could not be contained, and I
could feel the mist of tears in my eyes. Then, Jallaluddin
said, “Azad, we have always loved you, and we believe in
you. We shall always be proud of you”. The intensity and
purity of their faith in my capabilities broke my last
defences, and tears welled up in my eyes.

CREATION
[ 1963 – 1980 ]
4
Achievers
I
started my work at NASA at the Langley Research
Centre (LRC) in Hampton, Virginia. This is primarily an
R&D centre for advanced aerospace technology. One of
my most vivid memories
of LRC is of a piece of sculpture depicting a charioteer
driving two horses, one representing scientific research
and the other technological development, metaphorically
encapsulating the interconnection between research and
development.
From LRC I went to the Goddard Space Flight Centre
(GSFC) at Greenbelt, Maryland. This Centre develops and
manages most of NASA’s earth-orbiting science and
applications satellites. It operates NASA’s tracking
networks for all space missions. Towards the end of my
visit, I went to the Wallops Flight Facility at Wallops Island in
East Coast, Virginia. This place was the base for NASA’s
sounding rocket programme. Here, I saw a painting
prominently displayed in the reception lobby. It depicted a
battle scene with a few rockets flying in the background. A
painting with this theme should be the most commonplace
thing at a Flight Facility, but the painting caught my eye
because the soldiers on the side launching the rockets
were not white, but dark-skinned, with the racial features of
people found in South Asia. One day, my curiosity got the
better of me, drawing me towards the painting. It turned out
to be Tipu Sultan’s army fighting the British. The painting
depicted a fact forgotten in Tipu’s own country but
commemorated here on the other side of the planet. I was
happy to see an Indian glorified by NASA as a hero of
warfare rocketry.
My impression of the American people can be
summarized by a quotation from Benjamin Franklin, “Those
things that hurt instruct!” I realised that people in this part of
the world meet their problems head on. They attempt to get
out of them rather than suffer them.
My mother had once narrated an incident from the Holy
Book— after God created man, he asked the angels to
prostrate themselves before Adam. Everybody prostrated
themselves except Iblis, or Satan, who refused. “Why did
you not prostrate yourself?” Allah asked. “You created me
of fire and him of clay. Does not that make me nobler than
Adam?” Satan contended. God said, “Be gone from
paradise! This is no place for your contemptuous pride.”
Satan obeyed, but not before cursing Adam with the same
fate. Soon Adam followed suit by becoming a transgressor
after eating the forbidden fruit. Allah said, “Go hence and
may your descendants live a life of doubt and mistrust.”
What makes life in Indian organizations difficult is the
widespread prevalence of this very contemptuous pride. It
stops us from listening to our juniors, subordinates and
people down the line. You cannot expect a person to deliver
results if you humiliate him, nor can you expect him to be
creative if you abuse him or despise him. The line between
firmness and harshness, between strong leadership and
bullying, between discipline and vindictiveness is very fine,
but it has to be drawn. Unfortunately, the only line
prominently drawn in our country today is between the
‘heroes’ and the ‘zeros’. On one side are a few hundred
‘heroes’ keeping nine hundred and fifty million people down
on the other side. This situation has to be changed.
As the process of confronting and solving problems
often requires hard work and is painful, we have endless
procrastination. Actually, problems can be the cutting edge
that actually distinguish between success and failure. They
draw out innate courage and wisdom.
As soon as I returned from NASA, India’s first rocket
launch took place on 21 November 1963. It was a sounding
rocket, called NikeApache, made at NASA. The rocket was
assembled in the church building I have referred to earlier.
The only equipment available to transport the rocket was a
truck and a manually operated hydraulic crane. The
assembled rocket was to be shifted from the church
building to the launch pad by truck. When the rocket was
lifted by the crane and was about to be placed on the
launcher, it started tilting, indicating a leak in the hydraulic
system of the crane. As we were fast approaching the
launch time, 6 p.m., any repairs to the crane had to be ruled
out. Fortunately, the leak was not large and we managed to
lift the rocket manually, using our collective muscle power
and finally placing it on the launcher.
In the maiden Nike-Apache launch, I was in charge of
rocket integration and safety. Two of my colleagues who
played a very active and crucial role in this launch were D
Easwardas and R Aravamudan. Easwardas undertook the
rocket assembly and arranged the launch. Aravamudan,
whom we called Dan, was in charge of radar, telemetry and
ground support. The launch was smooth and problemfree.
We obtained excellent flight data and returned with a sense
of pride and accomplishment.
When we were relaxing the next evening at the dinner
table, we received news of the assassination of President
John F Kennedy in Dallas, Texas. We were appalled. The
Kennedy years were a significant era in America, when
young men were at the helm of affairs. I used to read with
interest about Kennedy’s moves in the missile crisis of late
1962. The Soviet Union built missile sites in Cuba, from
which it would have been possible to launch attacks on
American cities. Kennedy imposed a blockade or
‘quarantine’, barring the introduction of any offensive
missiles to Cuba. America also threatened to respond to
any Soviet nuclear attack from Cuba on any country in the
Western Hemisphere by retaliating against the USSR. After
fourteen days of intense drama, the crisis was resolved by
the Soviet Premier Khrushchev ordering that the Cuban
bases be dismantled and the missiles returned to Russia.
The next day, Prof. Sarabhai had a detailed discussion
with us on future plans. He was creating a new frontier in
the field of science and technology in India. A new
generation, scientists and engineers in their 30s and early
40s, was being charged with an unprecedented dynamism.
Our biggest qualifications at INCOSPAR were not our
degrees and training, but Prof. Sarabhai’s faith in our
capabilities. After the successful launch of Nike-Apache, he
chose to share with us his dream of an Indian Satellite
Launch Vehicle.
Prof. Sarabhai’s optimism was highly contagious. The
very news of his coming to Thumba would electrify people
and all laboratories, workshops and design offices would
hum with unceasing activity. People would work virtually
round the clock because of their enthusiasm to show Prof.
Sarabhai something new, something that had not been
done before in our country—be it a new design or a new
method of fabrication or even an out-of-the-way
administrative procedure. Prof. Sarabhai would often
assign multiple tasks to a single person or a group. Though
some of those tasks would appear totally unrelated in the
beginning, they would, at a later stage, emerge as deeply
interconnected. When Prof. Sarabhai was talking to us
about the Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV), he asked me,
almost in the same breath, to take up studies on a
rocketassisted take-off system (RATO) for military aircraft.
The two things had no apparent connection except in the
mind of this great visionary. I knew that all I had to do was to
remain alert and focussed on my purpose, and sooner or
later, an opportunity to do a challenging job would enter my
laboratory.
Prof. Sarabhai was ever-willing to try out novel
approaches and liked to draw in young people. He had the
wisdom and judgement which enabled him to realise not
only if something was well done, but also when it was time
to stop. In my opinion, he was an ideal experimenter and
innovator. When there were alternative courses of action
before us, whose outcome was difficult to predict, or to
reconcile varying perspectives, Prof. Sarabhai would resort
to experimentation to resolve the issue. This was precisely
the situation at INCOSPAR in 1963. A bunch of young,
inexperienced, but nevertheless energetic and enthusiastic
persons were given the task of fleshing out the spirit of
selfreliance in the field of science and technology in
general, and of space research in particular. It was a great
example of leadership by trust.
The rocket launch site later blossomed into the Thumba
Equatorial Rocket Launch Station (TERLS). TERLS was
established through active collaboration with France, USA
and USSR. The leader of the Indian space programme—
Prof. Vikram Sarabhai—had comprehended the full
implications of the challenge and had not balked at taking it
on. Right from the day INCOSPAR was formed, he was
aware of the need to organize an integrated national space
programme, with the equipment for the manufacture of
rockets and launch facilities developed and produced
indigenously.
With this in view, a wide-ranging programme for
scientific and technological development in rocket fuels,
propulsion systems, aeronautics, aerospace materials,
advanced 
fabrication 
techniques, 
rocket 
motor
instrumentation, control and guidance systems, telemetry,
tracking 
systems 
and 
scientific 
instruments 
for
experimentation in space were launched at the Space
Science and Technology Centre and the Physical
Research Laboratory at Ahmedabad. Incidentally, this
laboratory has produced a large number of Indian space
scientists of extremely high calibre over the years.
The real journey of the Indian aerospace programme,
however, had begun with the Rohini Sounding Rocket
(RSR) Programme. What is it that distinguishes a sounding
rocket from a Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV) and from a
missile? In fact, they are three different kinds of rockets.
Sounding rockets are normally used for probing the near-
earth environment, including the upper regions of the
atmosphere. While they can carry a variety of scientific
payloads to a range of altitudes, they cannot impart the final
velocity needed to orbit the payload. On the other hand, a
launch vehicle is designed to inject into orbit a
technological payload or satellite. The final stage of a
launch vehicle provides the necessary velocity for a satellite
to enter an orbit. This is a complex operation requiring on-
board guidance and control systems. A missile, though
belonging to the same family, is a still more complex
system. In addition to the large terminal velocity and
onboard guidance and control, it must have the capability to
home onto targets. When the targets are fast-moving and
capable of manoeuvring, a missile is also required to carry
out target-tracking functions.
The RSR programme was responsible for the
development and fabrication of sounding rockets and their
associated on-board systems for scientific investigations in
India. Under this programme, a family of operational
sounding rockets were developed. These rockets had wide
ranging capabilities, and to date several hundreds of these
rockets have been launched for various scientific and
technological studies.
I still remember that the first Rohini rocket consisted of a
single solid propulsion motor weighing a mere 32 kg. It
lifted a nominal 7 kg payload to an altitude of about 10 km.
It was soon followed by another, to which one more solid
propellant stage was added to dispatch multi-experiment
payloads weighing nearly 100 kg to an altitude of over 350
km.
The development of these rockets had resulted in a fully
indigenous capability in the production of sounding rockets
as well as their propellants. This programme had brought
into the country technology for the production of very high-
performance solid propellants, like those based on
polyurethane and polybutane polymer. It later resulted in the
setting up of a Propellant Fuel Complex (PFC) to
manufacture strategic chemicals required for rocket
engines, and a Rocket Propellant Plant (RPP) to produce
propellants.
The development of Indian rockets in the twentieth
century can be seen as a revival of the eighteenth century
dream of Tipu Sultan. When Tipu Sultan was killed, the
British captured more than 700 rockets and subsystems of
900 rockets in the battle of Turukhanahally in 1799. His
army had 27 brigades, called Kushoons, and each brigade
had a company of rocket men, called Jourks. These
rockets had been taken to England by William Congreve
and were subjected by the British to what we call ‘reverse
engineering’ today. There were, of course, no GATT, IPR
Act, or patent regime. With the death of Tipu, Indian
rocketry also met its demise—at least for 150 years.
Meanwhile, rocket technology made great strides
abroad. Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in Russia (1903), Robert
Goddard in USA (1914) and Hermann Oberth in Germany
(1923) gave rocketry new dimensions. In Nazi Germany,
Wernher von Braun’s group produced V-2 short range
ballistic missiles and showered fire on the Allied Forces.
After the war, both the USA and the USSR captured their
share of German rocket technology and rocket engineers.
With this booty, they started to run their deadly arms race
with missiles and warheads.
Rocketry was reborn in India thanks to the technological
vision of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Prof. Sarabhai
took the challenge of giving physical dimensions to this
dream. Very many individuals with myopic vision
questioned the relevance of space activities in a newly
independent nation which was finding it difficult to feed its
population. But neither Prime Minister Nehru nor Prof.
Sarabhai had any ambiguity of purpose. Their vision was
very clear: if Indians were to play a meaningful role in the
community of nations, they must be second to none in the
application of advanced technologies to their real-life
problems. They had no intention of using it merely as a
means to display our might.

Dreamers
D
uring his frequent visits to Thumba, Prof. Sarabhai
would openly review the progress of work with the entire
team. He never gave directions. Rather, through a free
exchange
of views, he led us forward into new terrain which often
revealed an unforeseen solution. Perhaps he was aware
that though a particular goal might be clear to himself, and
he could give adequate directions for its accomplishment,
his team members might have resisted working towards a
goal that made no sense to them. He considered the
collective understanding of the problem the main attribute
of effective leadership. He once told me, “Look, my job is to
make decisions; but it is equally important to see to it that
these decisions are accepted by my team members.”
In fact, Prof. Sarabhai took a series of decisions that
were to become the life-mission of many. We would make
our own rockets, our own Satellite Launch Vehicles (SLVs)
and our own satellites. And this would not be done one-by-
one but concurrently, in a multi-dimensional fashion. In the
development of payloads for the sounding rockets, instead
of getting a certain payload and then engineering it to fit
into the rocket, we discussed the matter threadbare with
the payload scientists working in different organ-izations
and at different locations. I may even say that the most
significant achievement of the sounding rocket programme
was to establish and maintain nation-wide mutual trust.
Perhaps realising that I preferred to persuade people to
do as they were told rather than use my legitimate authority,
Prof. Sarabhai assigned me the task of providing interface
support to payload scientists. Almost all physical
laboratories in India were involved in the sounding rocket
programme, each having its own mission, its own objective
and its own payload. These payloads were required to be
integrated to the rocket structure so as to ensure their
proper functioning and endurance under flight conditions.
We had X-ray payloads to look at stars; payloads fitted with
radio frequency mass spectrometers to analyse the gas
composition of the upper atmosphere; sodium payloads to
find out wind conditions, its direction and velocity. We also
had ionospheric payloads to explore different layers of the
atmosphere. I not only had to interact with scientists from
TIFR, National Physical Laboratory (NPL), and Physical
Research Laboratory (PRL), but also with payload
scientists from USA, USSR, France, Germany and Japan.
I often read Khalil Gibran, and always find his words full
of wisdom. “Bread baked without love is a bitter bread that
feeds but half a man’s hunger,”—those who cannot work
with their hearts achieve but a hollow, half-hearted success
that breeds bitterness all around. If you are a writer who
would secretly prefer to be a lawyer or a doctor, your written
words will feed but half the hunger of your readers; if you
are a teacher who would rather be a businessman, your
instructions will meet but half the need for knowledge of
your students; if you are a scientist who hates science, your
performance will satisfy but half the needs of your mission.
The personal unhappiness and failure to achieve results
that comes from being a round peg in a square hole is not,
by any means, new. But there are exceptions to this like
Prof. Oda and Sudhakar, who bring to their work a personal
touch of magic based upon their individual character,
personality, inner motives, and perhaps the dreams
crystallized within their hearts. They become so emotionally
involved with their work that any dilution of the success of
their effort fills them with grief.
Prof. Oda was an X-ray payload scientist from the
Institute of Space and Aeronautical Sciences (ISAS),
Japan. I remember him as a diminutive man with a towering
personality and eyes that radiated intelligence. His
dedication to his work was exemplary. He would bring X-
ray payloads from ISAS, which along with the X-ray
payloads made by Prof. UR Rao, would be engineered by
my team to fit into the nose cone of the Rohini Rocket. At
an altitude of 150 km, the nose cone would be separated
by explosion of pyros triggered by an electronic timer. With
this, the X-ray sensors would be exposed to space for
collecting the required information about the emissions
from stars. Together, Prof. Oda and Prof. Rao were a
unique blend of intellect and dedication, which one rarely
sees. One day, when I was working on the integration for
Prof. Oda’s payload with my timer devices, he insisted on
using the timers he had brought from Japan. To me they
looked flimsy, but Prof. Oda stuck to his stand that the
Indian timers be replaced by the Japanese ones. I yielded
to his suggestion and replaced the timers. The rocket took
off elegantly and attained the intended altitude. But the
telemetry signal reported mission failure on account of
timer malfunction. Prof. Oda was so upset that tears welled
up in his eyes. I was stunned by the emotional intensity of
Prof. Oda’s response. He had clearly put his heart and soul
into his work.
Sudhakar was my colleague in the Payload Preparation
Laboratory. As part of the pre-launch schedule, we were
filling and remotely pressing the hazardous sodium and
thermite mix. As usual, it was a hot and humid day at
Thumba. After the sixth such operation, Sudhakar and I
went into the payload room to confirm the proper filling of
the mix. Suddenly, a drop of sweat from his forehead fell
onto the sodium, and before we knew what was happening,
there was a violent explosion which shook the room. For a
few paralysed seconds, I did not know what to do. The fire
was spreading, and water would not extinguish the sodium
fire. Trapped in this inferno, Sudhakar, however, did not
lose his presence of mind. He broke the glass window with
his bare hands and literally threw me out to safety before
jumping out himself. I touched Sudhakar’s bleeding hands
in gratitude, he was smiling through his pain. Sudhakar
spent many weeks in the hospital recuperating from the
severe burns he had received.
At TERLS, I was involved with rocket preparation
activities, payload assembly, testing and evaluation
besides building subsystems like payload housing and
jettisonable nose cones. Working with the nose cones led
me, as a natural consequence, into the field of composite
materials.
It is interesting to know that the bows found, during
archaeological excavations at different sites in the country,
reveal that Indians used composite bows made of wood,
sinew, and horn as early as the eleventh century, at least
500 years before such bows were made in medieval
Europe. The versatility of composites, in the sense that they
possess very desirable structural, thermal, electrical,
chemical and mechanical properties, fascinated me. I was
so enthused with these man-made materials that I was in a
hurry to know everything about them almost overnight. I
used to read up everything available on related topics. I
was particularly interested in the glass and carbon Fibre
Reinforced Plastic (FRP) composites.
An FRP composite is composed of an inorganic fibre
woven into a matrix that encloses it and gives the
component its bulk form. In February 1969, Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi visited Thumba to dedicate TERLS to the
International Space Science Community. On this occasion,
she commissioned the country’s first filament winding
machine in our laboratory. This event brought my team,
which included CR Satya, PN Subramanian and MN
Satyanara-yana, great satisfaction. We made highstrength
glass cloth laminates to build non-magnetic payload
housings and flew them in two-stage sounding rockets. We
also wound and test flew rocket motor casings of up to 360
mm diameter.
Slowly, but surely, two Indian rockets were born at
Thumba. They were christened Rohini and Menaka, after
the two mythological dancers in the court of Indra, the king
of the sky. The Indian payloads no longer needed to be
launched by French rockets. Could this have been done but
for the atmosphere of trust and commitment which Prof.
Sarabhai had created at INCOSPAR? He brought into use
each person’s knowledge and skills. He made every man
feel directly involved in problem solving. By the very fact of
the team members’ participation, the solutions became
genuine and earned the trust of the entire team resulting in
total commitment towards implementation.
Prof. Sarabhai was matter-of-fact and never tried to
hide his disappointment. He used to talk with us in an
honest and objective manner. Sometimes I found him
making things look more positive than they actually were,
and then charming us by his almost magical powers of
persuasion. When we were at the drawing board, he would
bring someone from the developed world for a technical
collaboration. That was his subtle way of challenging each
one of us to stretch our capabilities.
At the same time, even if we failed to meet certain
objectives, 
he 
would 
praise 
whatever 
we 
had
accomplished. Whenever he found any one of us going
over his head and attempting a task for which he did not
have the capability or skill, Prof. Sarabhai would reassign
activity in such a way so as to lower pressure and permit
better quality work to be performed. By the time the first
Rohini-75 rocket was launched from TERLS on 20
November 1967, almost each one of us was in his own
groove.
Early next year, Prof. Sarabhai wanted to see me
urgently in Delhi. By now I was accustomed to Prof.
Sarabhai’s working methods. He was always full of
enthusiasm and optimism. In such a state of mind, sudden
flashes of inspiration were almost natural. On reaching
Delhi, I contacted Prof. Sarabhai’s secretary for an
appointment and was asked to meet him at 3.30 a.m. at
Hotel Ashoka. Delhi being a slightly unfamiliar place, with
an unfriendly climate for someone like me, conditioned to
the warm and humid climate of South India, I decided to
wait in the hotel lounge after finishing my dinner.
I have always been a religious person in the sense that I
maintain a working partnership with God. I was aware that
the best work required more ability than I possessed and
therefore I needed help that only God could give me. I made
a true estimate of my own ability, then raised it by 50 per
cent and put myself in God’s hands. In this partnership, I
have always received all the power I needed, and in fact
have actually felt it flowing through me. Today, I can affirm
that the kingdom of God is within you in the form of this
power, to help achieve your goals and realise your dreams.
There are many different types and levels of experience
that turn this internal power reaction critical. Sometimes,
when we are ready, the gentlest of contacts with Him fills us
with insight and wisdom. This could come from an
encounter with another person, from a word, a question, a
gesture or even a look. Many a time, it could come even
through a book, a conversation, some phrase, even a line
from a poem or the mere sight of a picture. Without the
slightest warning, something new breaks into your life and a
secret decision is taken, a decision that you may be
completely unconscious of, to start with.
I looked around the elegant lounge. Somebody had left
a book on a nearby sofa. As if to fill the small hours of that
cold night with some warm thoughts, I picked up the book
and started browsing. I must have turned only a few pages
of the book, about which I do not remember a thing today.
It was some popular book related to business
management. I was not really reading it, only skimming over
paragraphs and turning pages. Suddenly, my eyes fell on a
passage in the book, it was a quotation from George
Bernard Shaw. The gist of the quote was that all
reasonable men adapt themselves to the world. Only a few
unreasonable ones persist in trying to adapt the world to
themselves. All progress in the world depends on these
unreasonable men and their innovative and often
nonconformist actions.
I started reading the book from the Bernard Shaw
passage onwards. The author was describing certain
myths woven around the concept and the process of
innovation in industry and business. I read about the myth of
strategic planning. It is generally believed that substantial
strategic and technological planning greatly increases the
odds of a ‘no surprises’ outcome. The author was of the
opinion that it is essential for a project manager to learn to
live with uncertainty and ambiguity. He felt that it was a myth
to hold that the key to economic success is computability. A
quotation from General George Patton was given as a
counterpoint to this myth—that a good plan violently
executed right now is far better than a perfect plan
executed next week. It is a myth that to win big one must
strive to optimize, the author felt. Optimization wins only on
paper, but would invariably lose later in the real world, the
book said.
Waiting in the hotel lobby at 1 a.m. for an appointment
two hours later was certainly not a reasonable proposition,
neither for me nor for Prof. Sarabhai. But then, Prof.
Sarabhai had always exhibited a strong component of
unorthodoxy in his character. He was running the show of
space research in the country—under-staffed, overworked
— nevertheless in a successful manner.
Suddenly, I became aware of another man who came
and sat down on the sofa opposite mine. He was a well-
built person with an intelligent look and refined posture.
Unlike me—always disorderly in my dress— this man was
wearing elegant clothes. Notwithstanding the odd hours, he
was alert and vivacious.
There was a strange magnetism about him which
derailed the train of my thoughts on innovation. And before I
could get back to the book, I was informed that Prof.
Sarabhai was ready to receive me. I left the book on the
nearby sofa from where I had picked it up. I was surprised
when the man sitting on the opposite sofa was also asked
to come inside. Who was he? It was not long before my
question was answered. Even before we sat down, Prof.
Sarabhai introduced us to each other. He was Group
Captain VS Narayanan from Air Headquarters.
Prof. Sarabhai ordered coffee for both of us and
unfolded his plan of developing a rocket-assisted take-off
system (RATO) for military aircraft. This would help our
warplanes to take off from short runways in the Himalayas.
Hot coffee was served over small talk. It was totally
uncharacteristic of Prof. Sarabhai. But as soon as we
finished the coffee, Prof. Sarabhai rose and asked us to
accompany him to Tilpat Range on the outskirts of Delhi.
As we were passing through the lobby, I threw a cursory
glance at the sofa where I had left the book. It was not there.
It was about an hour’s drive to the Range. Prof.
Sarabhai showed us a Russian RATO. “If I get you the
motors of this system from Russia, could you do it in
eighteen months time?” Prof. Sarabhai asked us. “Yes, we
can!” Both Gp Capt VS Narayanan and I spoke almost
simultaneously. Prof. Sarabhai’s face beamed, reflecting
our fascination. I recalled what I had read, “He will bestow
on you a light to walk in.”
After dropping us back at the Hotel Ashoka, Prof.
Sarabhai went to the Prime Minister’s house for a
breakfast meeting. By that evening, the news of India taking
up the indigenous development of a device to help short run
take-offs by high performance military aircraft, with myself
heading the project, was made public. I was filled with many
emotions— happiness, gratitude, a sense of fulfilment and
these lines from a littleknown poet of the nineteenth-century
crossed my mind:
For all your days prepare
And meet them ever alike
When you are the anvil, bear –
When you are the hammer, strike.
RATO motors were mounted on aircraft to provide the
additional thrust required during the take-off run under
certain adverse operating conditions like partially bombed-
out runways, high altitude airfields, more than the
prescribed load, or very high ambient temperatures. The
Air Force was in dire need of a large number of RATO
motors for their S22 and HF-24 aircraft.
The Russian RATO motor shown to us at the Tilpat
Range was capable of generating a 3000 kg thrust with a
total impulse of 24500 kgseconds. It weighed 220 kg and
had a double base propellant encased in steel. The
development work was to be carried out at the Space
Science and Technology Centre with the assistance of the
Defence 
Research 
and 
Development 
Organization
(DRDO), HAL, DTD&P(Air) and Air Headquarters.
After a detailed analysis of the available options, I
chose a fibreglass motor casing. We decided in favour of a
composite propellant which gives a higher specific impulse
and aimed at a longer burning time to utilize it completely. I
also decided to take additional safety measures by
incorporating a diaphragm which would rupture if the
chamber pressure for some reason exceeded twice the
operating pressure. Two significant developments occurred
during the work on RATO. The first was the release of a
ten-year profile for space research in the country, prepared
by Prof. Sarabhai. This profile was not merely an activity
plan laid down by the top man for his team to comply with, it
was a theme paper meant for open discussions, to be later
transformed into a programme. In fact, I found it was the
romantic manifesto of a person deeply in love with the
space research programme in his country.
The plan mainly centred around the early ideas which
had been born at INCOSPAR; it included utilization of
satellites for television and developmental education,
meteorological observations and remote sensing for
management of natural resources. To this had been added
the development and launch of satellite launch vehicles.
The active international cooperation dominant in the
early years was virtually eased out in this plan and the
emphasis 
was 
on 
self-reliance 
and 
indigenous
technologies. The plan talked about the realisation of a
SLV for injecting lightweight satellites into a low earth orbit,
upgrading of Indian satellites from laboratory models to
space entities and development of a wide range of
spacecraft subsystems like the apogee and booster
motors, momentum wheel, and solar panel deployment
mechanism. It also promised a wide range of technological
spin-offs like the gyros, various types of transducers,
telemetry, adhesives, and polymers for non-space
applications. Over and above, there was the dream of an
adequate infrastructure that would be capable of supporting
R&D in a variety of engineering and scientific disciplines.
The second development was the formation of a Missile
Panel in the Ministry of Defence. Both Narayanan and I
were inducted as members. The idea of making missiles in
our own country was exciting, and we spent hours on end
studying the missiles of various advanced countries.
The distinction between a tactical missile and a
strategic missile is often a fine one. Generally, by
‘strategic’, it is understood that the missile will fly thousands
of kilometres. However, in warfare, this term is used to
denote the kind of target rather than its distance from
missile launch. Strategic missiles are those that strike at
the enemy’s heartland, either in counter-force attacks on
their strategic forces or in counter-value attacks on the
society, which in essence means his cities. Tactical
weapons are those that influence a battle, and the battle
may be by land, sea or air, or on all three together. This
categorization now appears nonsensical, as the US Air
Force’s ground-launched Tomahawk is used in a tactical
role, notwithstanding its range of some 3000 km. In those
days, however, strategic missiles were synonymous with
intermediate range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) with ranges in
the order of 1500 nautical miles or 2780 km and inter-
continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with a capability of
going even further.
Gp Capt Narayanan had an ineffable enthusiasm for
indigenous guided missiles. He was a great admirer of the
strong arm approach of the Russian Missile Development
Programme. “When it could be done there, why not here,
where space research has already prepared the soil for a
bonanza of missile technology?” Narayanan used to needle
me.
The bitter lessons of the two wars in 1962 and 1965
had left the Indian leadership with little choice in the matter
of achieving self-reliance in military hardware and weapon
systems. A large number of Surfaceto-Air Missiles (SAMs)
were obtained from the USSR to guard strategic locations.
Gp 
Capt 
Narayanan 
passionately 
advocated 
the
development of these missiles in the country.
While working together on RATO motors and on the
Missile Panel, Narayanan and I played the roles of student
and teacher interchangeably wherever required. He was
very eager to learn about rocketry and I was very curious to
know about airborne weapon systems. The depth of
Narayanan’s conviction and his force of application were
inspiring. Right from the day of our pre-dawn visit to the
Tilpat Range with Prof. Sarabhai, Narayanan was always
busy with his RATO motor. He had arranged everything that
was required before being asked. He obtained funding of
Rs 75 lakhs with a further commitment towards any
unforeseen costs. “You name the thing and I will get it for
you, but do not ask for time,” he said. At times, I often
laughed at his impatience, and read for him these lines
from T.S. Eliot’s Hollow Men:
Between the conception
And the creation
Between the emotion
And the response
Falls the Shadow.
Defence R&D at that time was heavily dependent on
imported equipment. Virtually nothing indigenous was
available. Together, we made a long shopping list and
drew up an import plan. But this made me unhappy—was
there no remedy or alternative? Was this nation doomed to
live with screwdriver technology? Could a poor country like
India afford this kind of development?
One day, while working late in the office, which was
quite routine after I took up the RATO projects, I saw a
young colleague, Jaya Chandra Babu going home. Babu
had joined us a few months ago and the only thing I knew
about him was that he had a very positive attitude and was
articulate. I called him into my office and did a bit of loud
thinking. “Do you have any suggestions?” I then asked him.
Babu remained silent for a while, and then asked for time
until the next evening to do some homework before
answering my question.
The next evening, Babu came to me before the
appointed time. His face was beaming with promise. “We
can do it, sir! The RATO system can be made without
imports. The only hurdle is the inherent inelasticity in the
approach of the organization towards procurement and
subcontracting, which would be the two major thrust areas
to avoid imports.” He gave me seven points, or, rather,
asked for seven liberties—financial approval by a single
person instead of an entire hierarchy, air travel for all
people on work irrespective of their entitlement,
accountability to only one person, lifting of goods by air-
cargo, sub-contracting to the private sector, placement of
orders on the basis of technical competence, and
expeditious accounting procedures.
These demands were unheard of in government
establishments, which tend to be conservative, yet I could
see the soundness of his proposition. The RATO project
was a new game and there was nothing wrong if it was to
be played with a new set of rules. I weighed all the pros and
cons of Babu’s suggestions for a whole night and finally
decided to present them to Prof. Sarabhai. Hearing my
plea for administrative liberalization and seeing the merits
behind it, Prof. Sarabhai approved the proposals without a
second thought.
Through his suggestions, Babu had highlighted the
importance of business acumen in developmental work
with high stakes. To make things move faster within
existing work parameters, you have to pump in more
people, more material and more money. If you can’t do that,
change your parameters! Instinctive businessman that he
was, Babu did not remain long with us and left ISRO for
greener pastures in Nigeria. I could never forget Babu’s
common sense in financial matters.
We had opted for a composite structure for the RATO
motor casing using filament fibre glass/epoxy. We had also
gone in for a high energy composite propellant and an
event-based ignition and jettisoning system in real-time. A
canted nozzle was designed to deflect the jet away from the
aircraft. We conducted the first static test of RATO in the
twelfth month of the project initiation. Within the next four
months, we conducted 64 static tests. And we were just
about 20 engineers working on the project!

Movers
The future satellite launch vehicle (SLV) had also been
conceived by this time. Recognising the immense socio-
economic benefits of space technology, Prof. Sarabhai
decided in 1969, to go full-steam ahead with the task of
establishing indigenous capability in building and launching
our own satellites. He personally participated in an aerial
survey of the east coast for a possible site for launching
satellite launch vehicles and large rockets.
Prof. Sarabhai was concentrating on the east coast in
order to let the launch vehicle take full advantage of the
earth’s west to east rotation. He finally selected the
Sriharikota island, 100 km north of Madras (now Chennai),
and thus the SHAR Rocket Launch Station was born. The
crescent-shaped island has a maximum width of 8 km and
lies alongside the coastline. The island is as big as Madras
city. The Buckingham Canal and the Pulicat lake form its
western boundary.
In 1968, we had formed the Indian Rocket Society.
Soon after, the INCOSPAR was reconstituted as an
advisory body under the Indian National Science Academy
(INSA) and the Indian Space Research Organization
(ISRO) was created under the Department of Atomic
Energy (DAE) to conduct space research in the country.
By this time, Prof. Sarabhai had already hand-picked a
team to give form to his dream of an Indian SLV. I consider
myself fortunate to have been chosen to be a project
leader. 
Prof. 
Sarabhai 
gave 
me 
the 
additional
responsibility of designing the fourth stage of the SLV. Dr
VR Gowarikar, MR Kurup and AE Muthunayagam were
given the tasks of designing the other three stages.
What made Prof. Sarabhai pick a few of us for this
great mission? One reason seemed to be our professional
background. Dr Gowarikar was doing outstanding work in
the field of composite propellants. MR Kurup had
established an excellent laboratory for propellants,
propulsion and pyrotechnics. Muthunayagam had proved
himself in the field of high energy propellants. The fourth
stage was to be a composite structure and called for a
large number of innovations in fabrication technology;
perhaps that was why I was brought in.
I laid the foundation for Stage IV on two rocks—sensible
approximation and unawed support. I have always
considered the price of perfection prohibitive and allowed
mistakes as a part of the learning process. I prefer a dash
of daring and persistence to perfection. I have always
supported learning on the part of my team members by
paying vigilant attention to each of their attempts, be they
successful or unsuccessful.
In my group, progress was recognized and reinforced at
every tiny step. Although I provided access to all the
information that my co-workers in Stage IV needed, I found I
could not spend enough time to be a useful facilitator and a
source of support. I wondered if there was something
wrong with the way in which I managed my time. At this
stage, Prof. Sarabhai brought a French visitor to our work
centre to point out the problem to me. This gentleman was
Prof. Curien, President of CNES (Centre Nationale de
Etudes Spatiales), our counterpart in France. They were
then developing the Diamont launch vehicles. Prof. Curien
was a thorough professional. Together, Prof. Sarabhai and
Prof. Curien helped me set a target. While they discussed
the means by which I could reach it, they also cautioned me
about the possibilities of failure. While I arrived at a better
awareness of Stage IV problems through the supportive
counselling of Prof. Curien, Prof. Sarabhai’s catalytic
intervention led Prof. Curien to reinterpret his own progress
in the Diamont programme.
Prof. Curien advised Prof. Sarabhai to relieve me of all
the minor jobs which posed little challenge and to give me
more opportunities for achievement. He was so impressed
by our well-planned efforts that he inquired if we could
make the Diamont’s fourth stage. I recall how this brought a
subtle smile to Prof. Sarabhai’s face.
As a matter of fact, the Diamont and SLV airframes
were incompatible. The diameters were quite different and
to attain interchangeability, some radical innovations were
required. I wondered where I should start. I decided to look
around for solutions among my own colleagues. I used to
carefully observe my colleagues to see if their daily routine
reflected their desire to constantly experiment. I also started
asking and listening to anyone who showed the slightest
promise. Some of my friends cautioned me about what they
termed as my naivete. I made it an unfailing routine to make
notes on individual suggestions and gave handwritten
notes to colleagues in engineering and design, requesting
concrete follow-up action within five or ten days.
This method worked wonderfully well. Prof. Curien
testified, while reviewing our progress, that we had
achieved in a year’s time what our counterparts in Europe
could barely manage in three years. Our plus point, he
noted, was that each of us worked with those below and
above in the hierarchy. I made it a point to have the team
meet at least once every week. Though it took up time and
energy, I considered it essential.
How good is a leader? No better than his people and
their commitment and participation in the project as full
partners! The fact that I got them all together to share
whatever little development had been achieved— results,
experiences, small successes, and the like—seemed to
me worth putting all my energy and time into. It was a very
small price to pay for that commitment and sense of
teamwork, which could in fact be called trust. Within my own
small group of people I found leaders, and learned that
leaders exist at every level. This was another important
aspect of management that I learned.
We had modified the existing SLV-IV Stage design to
suit the Diamont airframe. It was reconfigured and
upgraded from a 250 kg, 400 mm diameter stage to a 600
kg, 650 mm diameter stage. After two years’ effort, when
we were about to deliver it to CNES, the French suddenly
cancelled their Diamont BC programme. They told us that
they did not need our Stage IV anymore. It was a great
shock, making me re-live the earlier disappointments at
Dehra Dun, when I failed to get into the Air Force, and at
Bangalore, when the Nandi project was aborted at ADE.
I had invested great hope and effort in the fourth stage,
so that it could be flown with a Diamont rocket. The other
three stages of SLV, involving enormous work in the area
of rocket propulsion were at least five years away.
However, it did not take me long to shelve the
disappointment of Diamont BC Stage IV. After all, I had
thoroughly enjoyed working on this project. In time, RATO
filled the vacuum created in me by the Diamont BC Stage.
When the RATO project was underway, the SLV project
slowly started taking shape. Competence for all major
systems of a launch vehicle had been established in
Thumba by now. Through their outstanding efforts, Vasant
Gowarikar, MR Kurup and Muthunayagam prepared
TERLS for a big leap in rocketry.
Prof. Sarabhai was an exemplar in the art of team-
building. On one occasion, he had to identify a person who
could be given the responsibility for developing a
telecommand system for the SLV. Two men were
competent to carry out this task—one was the seasoned
and sophisticated UR Rao and the other was a relatively
unknown experimenter, G Madhavan Nair. Although I was
deeply impressed by Madhavan Nair’s dedication and
abilities, I did not rate his chances as very good. During
one of Prof. Sarabhai’s routine visits, Madhavan Nair boldly
demonstrated 
his 
improvised 
but 
highly 
reliable
telecommand system. Prof. Sarabhai did not take much
time to back the young experimenter in preference to an
established expert. Madhavan Nair not only lived up to the
expectations of his leader but even went beyond them. He
was to later become the project director of the Polar
Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV).
SLVs and missiles can be called first cousins: they are
different in concept and purpose, but come from the same
bloodline of rocketry. A massive missile development
project had been taken up by DRDO at the Defence
Research & Development Laboratory (DRDL), Hyderabad.
As the pace of this surface-to-air missile development
project increased, the frequency of the Missile Panel
meetings and my interaction with Gp Capt Narayanan also
increased.
In 1968, Prof. Sarabhai came to Thumba on one of his
routine visits. He was shown the operation of the nose-cone
jettisoning mechanism. As always, we were all anxious to
share the results of our work with Prof. Sarabhai. We
requested Prof. Sarabhai to formally activate the pyro
system through a timer circuit. Prof. Sarabhai smiled, and
pressed the button. To our horror, nothing happened. We
were dumbstruck. I looked at Pramod Kale, who had
designed and integrated the timer circuit. In a flash each of
us mentally went through an anlysis of the failure. We
requested Prof. Sarabhai to wait for a few minutes, then we
detached the timer device, giving direct connection to the
pyros. Prof. Sarabhai pressed the button again. The pyros
were fired and the nose cone was jettisoned. Prof.
Sarabhai congratulated Kale and me; but his expression
suggested that his thoughts were elsewhere. We could not
guess what was on his mind. The suspense did not last for
long and I got a call from Prof. Sarabhai’s secretary to meet
him after dinner for an important discussion.
Prof. Sarabhai was staying at the Kovalam Palace
Hotel, his usual home whenever he was in Trivandrum. I
was slightly perplexed by the summons. Prof. Sarabhai
greeted me with his customary warmth. He talked of the
rocket launching station, envisaging facilities like launch
pads, block houses, radar, telemetry and so on—things
which are taken for granted in Indian space research today.
Then he brought up the incident that had occurred that
morning. This was exactly what I had feared. My
apprehension of a reproach from my leader, however, was
unfounded. Prof. Sarabhai did not conclude that the failure
of the pyro timer circuit was the outcome of insufficient
knowledge and lack of skill on the part of his people or of
faulty understanding at the direction stage. He asked me
instead, if we were unenthused by a job that did not pose
sufficient challenge. He also asked me to consider if my
work was possibly being affected by any problem of which I
was hitherto unaware. He finally put his finger on the key
issue. We lacked a single roof to carry out system
integration of all our rocket stages and rocket systems.
Electrical and mechanical integration work was going on
with a significant phase difference—both in time and in
space. There was little effort to bring together the disparate
work on electrical and mechanical integration. Prof.
Sarabhai spent the next hour in re-defining our tasks, and,
in the small hours of the morning, the decision to set up a
Rocket Engineering Section was taken.
Mistakes can delay or prevent the proper achievement
of the objectives of individuals and organizations, but a
visionary like Prof. Sarabhai can use errors as
opportunities to promote innovation and the development of
new ideas. He was not especially concerned with the
mistake in the timer circuit, least of all with pinning the
blame for it. Prof. Sarabhai’s approach to mistakes rested
on the assumption that they were inevitable but generally
manageable. It was in the handling of the crises that arose
as a consequence that talent could often be revealed. I later
realised by experience, that the best way to prevent errors
was to anticipate them. But this time, by a strange twist of
fate, the failure of the timer circuit led to the birth of a rocket
engineering laboratory.
It was my usual practice to brief Prof. Sarabhai after
every Missile Panel Meeting. After attending one such
meeting in Delhi on 30 December 1971, I was returning to
Trivandrum. Prof. Sarabhai was visiting Thumba that very
day to review the SLV design. I spoke to him on the
telephone from the airport lounge about the salient points
that had emerged at the panel meeting. He instructed me to
wait at Trivandrum Airport after disembarking from the
Delhi flight, and to meet him there before his departure for
Bombay the same night.
When I reached Trivandrum, a pall of gloom hung in the
air. The aircraft ladder operator Kutty told me in a choked
voice that Prof. Sarabhai was no more. He had passed
away a few hours ago, following a cardiac arrest. I was
shocked to the core; it had happened within an hour of our
conversation. It was a great blow to me and a huge loss to
Indian science. That night passed in preparations for
airlifting Prof. Sarabhai’s body for the cremation in
Ahmedabad.
For five years, between 1966 to 1971, about 22
scientists and engineers had worked closely with Prof.
Sarabhai. All of them were later to take charge of important
scientific projects. Not only was Prof. Sarabhai a great
scientist, but also a great leader. I still remember him
reviewing the bi-monthly progress of the design projects of
SLV-3 in June 1970. Presentations on Stages I to IV were
arranged. The first three presentations went through
smoothly. Mine was the last presentation. I introduced five
of my team members who had contributed in various ways
to the design. To everybody’s surprise, each of them
presented his portion of the work with authority and
confidence. The presentations were discussed at length
and the conclusion was that satisfactory progress had been
made.
Suddenly, a senior scientist who worked closely with
Prof. Sarabhai turned to me and enquired, “Well, the
presentations for your project were made by your team
members based on their work. But what did you do for the
project?” That was the first time I saw Prof. Sarabhai really
annoyed. He told his colleague, “You ought to know what
project management is all about. We just witnessed an
excellent example. It was an outstanding demonstration of
team work. I have always seen a project leader as an
integrator of people and that is precisely what Kalam is.” I
consider Prof. Sarabhai as the Mahatma Gandhi of Indian
science —generating leadership qualities in his team and
inspiring them through both ideas and example.
After an interim arrangement with Prof. MGK Menon at
the helm, Prof. Satish Dhawan was given the responsibility
of heading ISRO. The whole complex at Thumba, which
included TERLS, the Space Science and Technology
Centre (SSTC), the RPP, the Rocket Fabrication Facility
(RFF), and the Propellant Fuel Complex (PFC) were
merged together to form an integrated space centre and
christened the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) as
a tribute to the man to whom it owed its existence. The
renowned metallurgist, Dr Brahm Prakash, took over as the
first Director of VSSC.
The RATO system was successfully tested on 8
October 1972 at Bareilly Air Force station in Uttar Pradesh,
when a high performance Sukhoi-16 jet aircraft became
airborne after a short run of 1200 m, as against its usual run
of 2 km. We used the 66th RATO motor in the test. The
demonstration was watched by Air Marshal Shivdev Singh
and Dr BD Nag Chaudhury, then the Scientific Adviser to
the Defence Minister. This effort was said to have saved
approximately Rs 4 crores in foreign exchange. The vision
of the industrialist scientist had finally borne fruit.
Before taking up the responsibility of organizing space
research in India and becoming the chairman of
INCOSPAR, Prof. Sarabhai had established a number of
successful industrial enterprises. He was aware that
scientific research could not survive in isolation, away from
industry. Prof. Sarabhai founded Sarabhai Chemicals,
Sarabhai Glass, Sarabhai Geigy Limited, Sarabhai Merck
Limited, and the Sarabhai Engineering Group. His Swastik
Oil Mills did pioneering work in the extraction of oil from
oilseeds, manufacture of synthetic detergents and of
cosmetics. He geared Standard Pharmaceuticals Limited
to enable large-scale manufacture of penicillin, which was
imported from abroad at astronomical costs at that time.
Now with the indigenization of RATO, his mission had
acquired a new dimension—independence in the
manufacture of military hardware and the potential saving of
crores of rupees in foreign exchange. I recalled this on the
day of the successful trial of the RATO system. Including
trial expenses, we spent less than Rs. 25 lakhs on the
entire project. The Indian RATO could be produced at
Rs.17,000 apiece, and it replaced the imported RATO,
which cost Rs. 33,000.
At the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, work on the
SLV went on at full swing. All the subsystems had been
designed, technologies identified, processes established,
work centres selected, manpower earmarked and
schedules drawn. The only hitch was the lack of a
management structure to effectively handle this mega-
project and coordinate activities which were spread over a
large number of work centres with their own ways of
working and management.
Prof. Dhawan, in consultation with Dr Brahm Prakash,
picked me for this job. I was appointed the Project
Manager—SLV, and reported directly to the Director,
VSSC. My first task was to work out a project management
plan. I wondered why I was selected for this task when there
were stalwarts like Gowarikar, Muthunayagam, and Kurup
around. With organizers like Easwardas, Aravamudan, and
SC Gupta available, how would I do better? I articulated my
doubts to Dr Brahm Prakash. He told me not to focus on
what I saw as other people’s strengths compared to my
own, but instead, to attempt to expand their abilities.
Dr Brahm Prakash advised me to take care of the
performance degraders and cautioned me against
outrightly 
seeking 
optimal 
performance 
from 
the
participating work centres. “Everyone will work to create
their bit of SLV; your problem is going to be your
dependency on others in accomplishing the total SLV. The
SLV mission will be accomplished with, and through, a
large number of people. You will require a tremendous
amount of tolerance and patience,” he said. It reminded me
of what my father used to read to me from the Holy Qur’an
on the distinction between right and wrong: “We have sent
no apostle before you who did not eat or walk about the
market squares. We test you by means of one another. Will
you not have patience?”
I was aware of the contradiction that often occurred in
such situations. People heading teams often have one of
the following two orientations: for some, work is the most
important motivation; for others, their workers are the all-
consuming interest. There are many others who fall either
between these two positions or outside them. My job was
going to be to avoid those who were interested neither in
the work nor in the workers. I was determined to prevent
people from taking either extreme, and to promote
conditions where work and workers went together. I
visualized my team as a group in which each member
worked to enrich the others in the team and experience the
enjoyment of working together.
The primary objectives of the SLV Project were design,
development and operation of a standard SLV system,
SLV-3, capable of reliably and expeditiously fulfilling the
specified mission of launching a 40 kg satellite into a 400
km circular orbit around the earth.
As a first step, I translated the primary project objectives
into some major tasks. One such task was the development
of a rocket motor system for the four stages of the vehicle.
The critical problems in the completion of this task were:
making an 8.6 tonne propellant grain and a high mass ratio
apogee rocket motor system which would use highenergy
propellants. Another task was vehicle control and guidance.
Three types of control systems were involved in this task—
aerodynamic surface control, thrust vector control and
reaction control for the first, second and third stages and
the spin-up mechanism for the fourth stage. Inertial
reference for control systems and guidance through inertial
measurement was also imperative. Yet another major task
was the augmentation of launch facilities at SHAR with
systems 
integration 
and 
checkout 
facilities 
and
development of launch support systems such as launchers
and vehicle assembly fixtures. A target of ‘all line’ flight test
within 64 months was set in March 1973.
I took up the executive responsibility of implementing
the project within the framework of policy decisions taken,
the approved management plan, and the project report; and
also within the budget and through the powers delegated to
me by the Director, VSSC. Dr Brahm Prakash formed four
Project Advisory Committees to advise me on specialized
areas like rocket motors, materials and fabrication, control
and guidance, electronics, and mission and launching. I
was assured of the guidance of outstanding scientists like
DS Rane, Muthunayagam, TS Prahlad, AR Acharya, SC
Gupta, and CL Amba Rao, to name a few.
The Holy Qur’an says: “We have sent down to you
revelations showing you an account of those who have
gone before you and an admonition to righteous men.” I
sought to share the wisdom of these extremely brilliant
people. “Light upon light. Allah guides to His light whom He
will. He has knowledge of all things.”
We made three groups to carry out the project activities
—a Programme Management Group, an Integration and
Flight Testing Group and a Subsystems Development
Group. The first Group was made responsible for looking
after the overall executive aspects of SLV-3: project
management, including administration, planning and
evaluation, 
subsystems 
specifications, 
materials,
fabrication, quality assurance and control. The Integration
and Flight Testing Group was assigned the tasks of
generation of facilities required for integration and flight
testing of SLV-3. They were also asked to carry out the
analysis of the vehicle, including mechanical and
aerodynamic 
interface 
problems. 
The 
Subsystems
Development Group was given the job of interacting with
various divisions of VSSC and was made responsible for
ensuring that all technological problems in the development
of various subsystems were overcome by creating a
synergy amongst the available talent in these divisions.
I projected a requirement of 275 engineers and
scientists for SLV-3 but could get only about 50. If it had not
been for synergistic efforts, the whole project would have
remained a non-starter. Some young engineers like MSR
Dev, G Madhavan Nair, S Srinivasan, US Singh,
Sunderrajan, Abdul Majeed, Ved Prakash Sandlas,
Namboodiri, Sasi Kumar, and Sivathanu Pillai developed
their own ground rules designed to help them work
efficiently as a project team, and produced outstanding
individual and team results. These men were in the habit of
celebrating their successes together—in a sort of mutual
appreciation club. This boosted morale, and helped them a
great deal to accept setbacks and to revitalize themselves
after periods of intense work.
Each member of the SLV-3 project team was a
specialist in his own field. It was natural therefore that each
one of them valued his independence. To manage the
performance of such specialists the team leader has to
adopt a delicate balance between the hands-on and the
hands-off approach. The hands-on approach takes an
active interest on a very regular basis in the members’
work. The hands-off approach trusts team members and
recognizes their need for autonomy to carry out their roles,
as they see fit. It hinges on their self-motivation. When the
leader goes too far with the hands-on approach, he is seen
as an anxious and interfering type. If he goes too far hands-
off, he is seen as abdicating his responsibility or not being
interested. Today, the members of the SLV-3 team have
grown to lead some of the country’s most prestigious
programmes. MSR Dev heads the Augmented Satellite
Launch Vehicle (ASLV) project, Madhavan Nair is the chief
of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) project and
Sandlas and Sivathanu Pillai are Chief Controllers in
DRDO Headquarters. Each one of these men rose to his
present position through consistent hard work and rocklike
will power. It was indeed an exceptionally talented team.

aving taken up the leadership of executing the SLV-3
project, I faced urgent and conflicting demands on my time
—for 
committee 
work, 
material 
procurement,
correspondence,
reviews, briefings, and for the need to be informed on a
wide range of subjects.
My day would start with a stroll of about 2 km around the
lodge I was living in. I used to prepare a general schedule
during my morning walk, and emphasize two or three things
I would definitely like to accomplish during the day,
including at least one thing that would help achieve long-
term goals.
Once in the office, I would clean the table first. Within the
next ten minutes, I would scan all the papers and quickly
divide them into different categories: those that required
immediate action, low priority ones, ones that could be kept
pending, and reading material. Then I would put the high
priority papers in front of me and everything else out of
sight.
Coming back to SLV-3, about 250 sub-assemblies and
44 major subsystems were conceived during the design.
The list of materials went up to over 1 million components.
A project implementation strategy had become essential to
achieve sustained viability of this complex programme of
seven to ten years’ duration. From his side, Prof. Dhawan
came up with a clear statement that all the manpower and
funds at VSSC and SHAR would have to be directed to us.
From our side, we evolved a matrix type of management to
achieve productive interfacing with more than 300
industries. The target was that our interaction with them
must lead to their technology empowerment. Three things I
stressed before my colleagues—importance of design
capability, goal setting and realisation, and the strength to
withstand setbacks. Now, before I dwell on the finer
aspects of the management of the SLV-3 project, let me
talk about the SLV-3 itself.
It is interesting to describe a launch vehicle
anthropomorphically. The main mechanical structure may
be visualized as the body of a human being, the control and
guidance systems with their associated electronics
constitute the brain. The musculature comes from
propellants. How are they made? What are the materials
and techniques involved?
A large variety of materials go into the making of a
launch vehicle— both metallic and non-metallic, which
include composites and ceramics. In metals, different types
of stainless steel, alloys of aluminium, magnesium, titanium,
copper, beryllium, tungsten and molybdenum are used.
Composite materials are composed of a mixture or
combination of two or more constituents which differ in form
and material composition and which are essentially
insoluble in one another. The materials which combine may
be metallic, organic or inorganic. While other material
combinations possible are virtually unlimited, the most
typical composites in launch vehicles are made of structural
constituents, embedded in a matrix. We used a large
variety of glass fibre reinforced plastic composites and
opened avenues for the entry of Kevlar, polyamides and
carbon-carbon composites. Ceramics are special types of
baked clay used for microwave transparent enclosures. We
considered using ceramics, but had to reject the idea then
due to technological limitations.
Through mechanical engineering, these materials are
transformed into hardware. In fact, of all the engineering
disciplines which feed directly into the development of
rocketry, mechanical engineering is perhaps the most
intrinsic one. Be it a sophisticated system like a liquid
engine or a piece of hardware as simple as a fastener, its
ultimate fabrication calls for expert mechanical engineers
and precision machine tools. We decided to develop
important technologies like welding techniques for low-alloy
stainless steel, electroforming techniques, and ultra-
precision process tooling. We also decided to make some
important machines in-house, like the 254-litre vertical
mixer and the groove machining facility for our third and
fourth stages. Many of our subsystems were so massive
and complex that they implied sizeable financial outlays.
Without any hesitation, we approached industries in the
private sector and developed contract management plans
which later became blueprints for many government-run
science and technology business organizations.
Coming to the life part of the SLV, there is the complex
electrical circuitry, which sets the mechanical structure in
motion. This vast spectrum of activities, encompassing
simple electrical power supplies to sophisticated
instrumentation as well as guidance and control systems is
collectively referred to in aerospace research as ‘Avionics’.
Development efforts in avionic systems had already been
initiated at VSSC in the field of digital electronics,
microwave radars and radar transponders, and inertial
components and systems. It is very important to know the
state of the SLV when it is in flight. SLV brought a new
surge of activity in the development of a variety of
transducers for measurement of physical parameters like
pressure, 
thrust, 
vibration, 
acceleration, 
etc. 
The
transducers convert the physical parameters of the vehicle
into electrical signals. An on-board telemetry system
processes these signals suitably and transmits them in the
form of radio signals to the ground stations, where they are
received and deciphered back to the original information
collected by the transducers. If the systems work according
to design there is little cause for concern; but in case
something goes wrong, the vehicle must be destroyed to
stop it from making any unexpected moves. To ensure
safety, a special tele-command system was made to
destroy the rocket in case it malfunctions, and an
interferrometer system was developed to determine the
range and position of the SLV, as a added means to the
radar system. The SLV project also initiated the indigenous
production of sequencers which time the various events,
such as ignition, stage separation, vehicle altitude
programmers which store the information for the rocket
manoeuvres, and auto-pilot electronics which take
appropriate decisions to steer the rocket along its
predetermined path.
Without the energy to propel the whole system, a launch
vehicle remains grounded. A propellant is usually a
combustible substance that produces heat and supplies
ejection particles in a rocket engine. It is both a source of
energy and a working substance for expanding energy.
Because the distinction is more decisive in rocket engines,
the term propellant is used primarily to describe chemicals
carried by rockets for propulsive purposes.
It is customary to classify propellants as either solids or
liquids. We concentrated on solid propellants. A solid
propellant consists essentially of three components: the
oxidizer, the fuel and the additives. Solid propellants are
further classified into two types: composite and double
base. The former consists of an oxidizer or inorganic
material (like ammonium perchlorate) in a matrix of organic
fuel (like synthetic rubber). Double base propellants were
distant dreams those days but nevertheless we dared to
dream about them.
All this self sufficiency and indigenous manufacture
came gradually, and not always without pain. We were a
team of almost self-trained engineers. In retrospect I feel
the unique blend of our untutored talent, character, and
dedication suited SLV development the most. Problems
surfaced regularly and almost consistently. But my team
members never exhausted my patience. I recall writing after
winding up a late night shift:
Beautiful hands are those that do
Work that is earnest and brave and true
Moment by moment
The long day through.
Almost parallel to our work on SLV, the DRDO was
preparing itself for developing an indigenous surface-to-air
missile. The RATO project was abandoned because the
aircraft for which it was designed became obsolete. The
new aircraft did not need RATO. With the project called off,
Narayanan was DRDO’s logical choice to lead the team for
making the missile. Unlike us at ISRO, they preferred the
philosophy of one-toone substitution rather than technology
development and performance upgrading. The Surface-to-
Air Missile SA–2 of Russian origin was chosen to acquire
detailed knowledge of all the design parameters of a
proven missile and to establish, thereby, the necessary
infrastructure required in the organization. It was thought
that once one-to-one indigenization was established,
further advances in the sophisticated field of guided
missiles would be a natural fall-out. The project was
sanctioned in February 1972 with the code name Devil and
funding of about Rs. 5 crore was made available for the first
three years. Almost half of it was to go in foreign exchange.
By now promoted to Air Commodore, Narayanan took
over as Director, DRDL. He mobilized this young laboratory
located in the southeastern suburbs of Hyderabad to take
up this enormous task. The landscape dotted with tombs
and old buildings started reverberating with new life.
Narayanan was a man of tremendous energy—a man
always in the boost phase. He gathered around him a
strong group of enthusiastic people, drawing many service
officers into this predominantly civilian laboratory. Totally
preoccupied with the SLV affairs, my participation in the
Missile Panel meetings gradually dwindled, and then
stopped altogether. However, stories about Narayanan and
his Devil were beginning to reach Trivandrum. A
transformation of an unprecedented scale was taking place
there.
During my association with Narayanan in the RATO
project, I had discovered that he was a hard taskmaster—
one who went all out for control, mastery and domination. I
used to wonder if managers like him, who aim at getting
results no matter what the price, would face a rebellion of
silence and non-cooperation in the long run.
New Year’s day, 1975, brought with it an opportunity to
have a firstperson assessment of the work going on under
Narayanan’s leadership. Prof. MGK Menon, who was
working then as Scientific Advisor to the Defence Minister
and was head of the DRDO, appointed a review committee
under the chairmanship of Dr Brahm Prakash to evaluate
the work carried out in the Devil Project. I was taken into the
team as a rocket specialist to evaluate the progress made
in the areas of aerodynamics, structure and propulsion of
the missile. On the propulsion aspects, I was assisted by
BR Somasekhar and by Wg Cdr P Kamaraju. The
committee members included Dr RP Shenoy and Prof. IG
Sarma who were to review the work done on the electronic
systems.
We met at DRDL on 1 and 2 January 1975, followed by
a second session after about six weeks. We visited the
various development work centres and held discussions
with the scientists there. I was greatly impressed by the
vision of AV Ranga Rao, the dynamism of Wg Cdr R
Gopalaswami, the thoroughness of Dr I Achyuta Rao, the
enterprise of G Ganesan, S Krishnan’s clarity of thought
and R Balakrishnan’s critical eye for detail. The calm of JC
Bhattacharya and Lt Col R Swaminathan in the face of
immense complexities was striking. The zeal and
application of Lt Col VJ Sundaram was conspicuous. They
were a brilliant, committed group of people—a mix of
service officers and civilian scientists—who had trained
themselves in the areas of their own interest out of their
driving urge to fly an Indian missile.
We had our concluding meeting towards the end of
March 1975 at Trivandrum. We felt that the progress in the
execution of the project was adequate in respect of
hardware fabrication to carry out the philosophy of one-to-
one substitution of missile subsystems except in the liquid
rocket area, where some more time was required to
succeed. The committee was of the unanimous opinion that
DRDL had achieved the twin goals of hardware fabrication
and system analysis creditably in the design and
development of the ground electronics complex assigned
to them.
We 
observed 
that 
the 
one-to-one 
substitution
philosophy had taken precedence over the generation of
design data. Consequently, many design engineers had not
been able to pay adequate attention to the necessary
analysis which was the practice followed by us at VSSC.
The system analysis studies carried out up to then had also
been only of a preliminary nature. In all, the results
accomplished were outstanding, but we still had a long way
to go. I recalled a school poem:
Don’t worry and fret, fainthearted,
The chances have just begun,
For the best jobs haven’t been started,
The best work hasn’t been done.
The committee made a strong recommendation to the
Government to give Devil a further go-ahead. Our
recommendation was accepted and the project proceeded.
Back home at VSSC, SLV was taking shape. In
contrast to the DRDL which was sprinting ahead, we were
moving slowly. Instead of following the leader, my team was
trekking towards success on several individual paths. The
essence of our method of work was an emphasis on
communication, particularly in the lateral direction, among
the teams and within the teams. In a way, communication
was my mantra for managing this gigantic project. To get
the best from my team members, I spoke to them frequently
on the goals and objectives of the organization,
emphasizing the importance of each member’s specific
contribution towards the realisation of these goals. At the
same time, I tried to be receptive to every constructive idea
emanating from my subordinates and to relay it in an
appropriate 
form 
for 
critical 
examination 
and
implementation. I had written somewhere in my diary of that
period:
If you want to leave your footprints
On the sands of time
Do not drag your feet.
Most of the time, communication gets confused with
conversation. In fact, the two are distinctly different. I was
(and am) a terrible conversationalist but consider myself a
good communicator. A conversation full of pleasantries is
most often devoid of any useful information, whereas
communication is meant only for the exchange of
information. It is very important to realise that
communication is a twoparty affair which aims at passing
on or receiving a specific piece of information.
While working on the SLV, I used communication to
promote understanding and to come to an agreement with
colleagues in defining the problems that existed and in
identifying the action necessary to be taken to solve them.
Authentic communication was one of the tools skilfully used
in managing the project. How did I do that ? To begin with, I
tried to be factual and never sugar-coated the bitter pill of
facts. At one of the Space Science Council (SSC) review
meetings, frustrated by the procurement delays, I erupted
into an agitated complaint against the indifference and red-
tape tactics of the controller of accounts and financial
advisor of VSSC. I insisted that the systems of work
followed by the accounts staff had to change and
demanded the delegation of their functions to the project
team. Dr Brahm Prakash was taken aback by the bluntness
of my submission. He stubbed out his cigarette and walked
out of the meeting.
I spent the whole night regretting the pain my harsh
words had caused Dr Brahm Prakash. However, I was
determined to fight the inertia built into the system before I
found myself being dragged down with it. I asked myself a
practical question: could one live with these insensitive
bureaucrats? The answer was a big no. Then I asked
myself a private question: what would hurt Dr Brahm
Prakash more, my seemingly harsh words now, or the
burial of the SLV at a later stage? Finding my head and
heart agreeing, I prayed to God for help. Fortunately for me,
Dr Brahm Prakash delegated financial powers to the
project the next morning.
Anyone who has taken up the responsibility to lead a
team can be successful only if he is sufficiently
independent, powerful and influential in his own right to
become a person to reckon with. This is perhaps also the
path to individual satisfaction in life, for freedom with
responsibility is the only sound basis for personal
happiness. What can one do to strengthen personal
freedom? I would like to share with you two techniques I
adopt in this regard.
First, by building your own education and skills.
Knowledge is a tangible asset, quite often the most
important tool in your work. The more up-to-date the
knowledge you possess, the freer you are. Knowledge
cannot be taken away from anyone except by
obsolescence. A leader can only be free to lead his team if
he keeps abreast of all that is happening around him—in
real time. To lead, in a way, is to engage in continuing
education. In many countries, it is normal for professionals
to go to college several nights every week. To be a
successful team leader, one has to stay back after the din
and clutter of a working day to emerge better-equipped and
ready to face a new day.
The second way is to develop a passion for personal
responsibility. The sovereign way to personal freedom is to
help determine the forces that determine you. Be active!
Take on responsibility! Work for the things you believe in. If
you do not, you are surrendering your fate to others. The
historian Edith Hamilton wrote of ancient Greece, “When
the freedom they wished for most was freedom from
responsibility, then Athens ceased to be free and was
never free again”. The truth is that there is a great deal that
most of us can individually do to increase our freedom. We
can combat the forces that threaten to oppress us. We can
fortify ourselves with the qualities and conditions that
promote individual freedom. In doing so, we help to create
a 
stronger 
organization, 
capable 
of 
achieving
unprecedented goals.
As work on the SLV gained momentum, Prof. Dhawan
introduced the system of reviewing progress with the entire
team involved in the project. Prof. Dhawan was a man with
a mission. He would effortlessly pull together all the loose
ends to make work move smoothly. At VSSC the review
meetings presided over by Prof. Dhawan used to be
considered major events. He was a true captain of the
ISRO ship—a commander, navigator, housekeeper, all
rolled into one. Yet, he never pretended to know more than
he did. Instead, when something appeared ambiguous, he
would ask questions and discuss his doubts frankly. I
remember him as a leader for whom to lead with a firm, but
fair hand, was a moral compulsion. His mind used to be
very firm once it had been decided on any issue. But before
taking a decision, it used to be like clay, open to
impressions until the final moulding. Then the decisions
would be popped into the potter’s oven for glazing, never
failing to emerge hard and tough, resistant and enduring.
I had the privilege of spending a great deal of time with
Prof. Dhawan. He could hold the listener enthralled
because of the logical, intellectual acumen he could bring to
bear on his analysis of any subject. He had an unusual
combination of degrees—a B.Sc. in Mathematics and
Physics, an M.A. in English Literature, B.E. in Mechanical
Engineering, M.S. in Aeronautical Engineering followed by
a Ph.D. in Aeronautics and Mathematics from the
California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in USA.
Intellectual debates with him were very stimulating and
could always mentally energize me and my team members.
I found him full of optimism and compassion. Although he
often judged himself harshly, with no allowances or
excuses, he was generous to a fault when it came to others.
Prof. Dhawan used to sternly pronounce his judgements
and then pardon the contrite guilty parties.
In 1975, ISRO became a government body. An ISRO
council was formed consisting of Directors of different work
centres and senior officers in the Department of Space
(DoS). This provided a symbolic link as well as a forum for
participative management between the DoS which had the
Governmental powers and the centres which would execute
the jobs. In the traditional parlance of Government
departments, ISRO’s centres would have been subordinate
units or attached offices, but such words were never
spoken either at ISRO or DoS. Participative management,
which calls for active interaction between those who wield
administrative powers and the executing agencies, was a
novel feature of ISRO management that would go a long
way in Indian R&D organizations.
The new set-up brought me in contact with TN Seshan,
the Joint Secretary in the DoS. Till then, I had a latent
reservation about bureaucrats, so I was not very
comfortable when I first saw Seshan participating in a SLV-
3 Management Board meeting. But soon, it changed to
admiration for Seshan, who would meticulously go through
the agenda and always come for the meetings prepared.
He used to kindle the minds of scientists with his
tremendous analytical capability.
The first three years of the SLV project was the period
for the revelation of many fascinating mysteries of science.
Being human, ignorance has always been with us, and
always will be. What was new was my awareness of it, my
awakening to its fathomless dimensions. I used to
erroneously suppose that the function of science was to
explain everything, and that unexplained phenomena were
the province of people like my father and Lakshmana
Sastry. However, I always refrained from discussing these
matters with any of my scientist colleagues, fearing that it
would threaten the hegemony of their meticulously formed
views.
Gradually, I became aware of the difference between
science 
and 
technology, 
between 
research 
and
development. Science is inherently open-ended and
exploratory. Development is a closed loop. Mistakes are
imperative in development and are made every day, but
each mistake is used for modification, upgradation or
betterment. Probably, the Creator created engineers to
make scientists achieve more. For each time scientists
come up with a thoroughly researched and fully
comprehended solution, engineers show them yet another
lumineu, yet one more possibility. I cautioned my team
against becoming scientists. Science is a passion—a
never-ending voyage into promises and possibilities. We
had only limited time and limited funds. Our making the
SLV depended upon our awareness of our own limits. I
preferred existing workable solutions which would be the
best options. Nothing that is new comes into time-bound
projects without its own problems. In my opinion, a project
leader should always work with proven technologies in
most of the systems as far as possible and experiment only
from multiple resources.

The SLV-3 project had been formulated in such a way
that the major technology work centres, both at VSSC and
at SHAR could handle propellant production, rocket motor
testing and launch of any large diameter rocket. As
participants in the SLV-3 project, we set three milestones
for ourselves: development and flight qualification of all
subsystems through sounding rockets by 1975; sub-orbital
flights by 1976; and the final orbital flight in 1978. The work
tempo had picked up now and the atmosphere was
charged with excitement. Wherever I went, our teams had
something interesting to show me. A large number of things
were being done for the first time in the country and the
groundlevel technicians had had no prior exposure to this
kind of work. I saw new performance dimensions growing
among my team members.
Performance dimensions are factors that lead to
creation. They go beyond competencies such as the skills
and knowledge of the individual. Performance dimensions
are broader and deeper than what a person must know and
be able to do in order to function well in his or her job. They
include attitudes, values and character traits. They exist at
various levels of the human personality. At the behavioural
level—at the outermost ring of the tree—we can observe
skills and measure knowledge. Social roles and self-image
dimensions are found at the intermediate level. Motives
and traits exist at the innermost or core level. If we can
identify those performance dimensions which are most
highly correlated with job success, we can put them
together to form a blueprint for outstanding performance in
both thought and action.
Although SLV-3 was still in the future, its subsystems
were being completed. In June 1974, we used the Centaur
sounding rocket launch to test some of our critical systems.
A scaled down heat shield of SLV, Rate Gyro Unit, and
Vehicle Attitude Programmer were integrated into the
Centaur rocket. The three systems involved wide-ranging
expertise— composite materials, control engineering and
software, none of them ever having been tried before in the
country. The test was a complete success. Until then the
Indian Space Programme had not gone beyond sounding
rockets and even knowledgeable people were not ready to
see and acknowledge its efforts as anything more serious
than fiddling around with meteorological instruments. For
the first time, we inspired the confidence of the nation.
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi told Parliament on 24 July
1974, “The development and fabrication of relevant
technologies, subsystems and hardware (to make India’s
first Satellite Launch Vehicle) are progressing satisfactorily.
A number of industries are engaged in the fabrication of
components. The first orbital flight by India is scheduled to
take place in 1978.”
Like any other act of creation, the creation of the SLV-3
also had its painful moments. One day, when my team and I
were totally engrossed in the preparation of the static test
of the first stage motor, the news of a death in the family
reached me. My brother-in-law and mentor Jenab Ahmed
Jallaludin, was no more. For a couple of minutes, I was
immobilized, I could not think, could not feel anything. When
I could focus on my surroundings once more and attempted
to participate in the work, I found myself talking incoherently
—and then I realised that, with Jallaluddin, a part of me had
passed away too. A vision of my childhood reappeared
before me—evening walks around the Rameswaram
temple, shining sand and dancing tides in the moonlight,
stars looking down from an unlit sky on a new moon night,
Jallaluddin showing me the horizon sinking into the sea,
arranging money for my books, and seeing me off at Santa
Cruz airport. I felt that I had been thrown into a whirlpool of
time and space. My father, by now more than a hundred
years old, pallbearer for his son-in-law, who had been half
his age; the bereft soul of my sister Zohara, her wounds
from the loss of her four-year-old son still raw—these
images came before my eyes in a blur, too terrible for me
to comprehend. I leaned on the assembly jig, composed
myself and left a few instructions with Dr S Srinivasan,
Deputy Project Director, to carry on with the work in my
absence.
Travelling overnight in a combination of district buses, I
reached Rameswaram only the next day. During this time, I
did my best to free myself from the very past which
appeared to have come to an end with Jallaluddin. But the
moment I reached my house, grief assailed me afresh. I
had no words for Zohara or for my niece Mehboob, both of
whom were crying uncontrollably. I had no tears to shed.
We sorrowfully put Jallaluddin’s body to rest.
My father held my hands for a long time. There were no
tears in his eyes either. “Do you not see, Abul, how the Lord
lengthens the shadows? Had it been His will, He could have
made them constant. But He makes the sun their guide,
little by little He shortens them. It is He who has made the
night a mantle for you, and sleep a rest. Jallaluddin has
gone into a long sleep—a dreamless sleep, a complete
rest of all his being within simple unconsciousness. Nothing
will befall us except what Allah has ordained. He is our
Guardian. In Allah, my son, put your trust.” He slowly closed
his wrinkled eyelids and went into a trance-like state.
Death has never frightened me. After all, everyone has
to go one day. But perhaps Jallaluddin went a little too
early, a little too soon. I could not bring myself to stay for
long at home. I felt the whole of my inner self drowning in a
sort of anxious agitation, and inner conflicts between my
personal and my professional life. For many days, back in
Thumba, I felt a sense of futility I had never known before—
about everything I was doing.
I had long talks with Prof. Dhawan. He told me that my
progress on the SLV project would bring me solace. The
confusion would first lessen and would later pass away
altogether. He drew my attention to the wonders of
technology and its achievements.
Gradually, the hardware began emerging from the
drawing boards. Sasi Kumar built a very effective network
of fabrication work centres. Within days of getting a
component drawing, he would embark on the fabrication
with what was available. Namboodiri and Pillai were
spending their days and nights at the propulsion laboratory
developing four rocket motors simultaneously. MSR Dev
and Sandlas drew up meticulous plans for mechanical and
electrical integration of the vehicle. Madhavan Nair and
Murthy examined the systems developed by the VSSC
electronics laboratories and engineered them into flight
sub- systems wherever it was possible. US Singh brought
up the first launch ground system, comprising of telemetry,
tele-command, and radar. He also chalked out a detailed
work plan with SHAR for the flight trials. Dr Sundararajan
closely monitored mission objectives and concurrently
updated the systems. Dr Srinivasan, a competent launch
vehicle designer, discharged all my complementary and
supplementary functions as the SLV deputy project
director. He noticed what I had overlooked, heard the
points I failed to listen to, and suggested possibilities that I
had not so much as visualized.
We learned the hard way that the biggest problem of
project management is to achieve a regular and efficient
interfacing between the different individuals and work
centres. Hard work can be set at nought in the absence of
proper coordination.
I had the fortune of having YS Rajan from the ISRO
headquarters as my friend in those times. Rajan was (and
is) a universal friend. His friendship embraced with equal
warmth turners, fitters, electricians and drivers as well as
scientists, engineers, contractors and bureaucrats. Today
when the press calls me a ‘welder of people’, I attribute this
to Rajan. His close interaction with different work centres
created such a harmony in SLV affairs that the fine threads
of individual efforts were woven into a mighty fabric of great
strength.
In 1976, my father passed away. He had been in poor
health for quite some time due to his advanced age. The
death of Jallaluddin had also taken a toll on his health and
spirit. He had lost his desire to live, as though after seeing
Jallaluddin return to his divine source, he too had become
eager to return to his.
Whenever I learnt about my father’s indifferent health, I
would visit Rameswaram with a good city doctor. Every
time I did so, he would chide me for my unnecessary
concern and lecture me on the expenses incurred on the
doctor. “Your visit is enough for me to get well, why bring a
doctor and spend money on his fees?” he would ask. This
time he had gone beyond the capabilities of any doctor,
care or money. My father Jainulabdeen, who had lived on
Rameswaram island for 102 years, had passed away
leaving 
behind 
fifteen 
grandchildren 
and 
one
greatgrandson. He had led an exemplary life. Sitting alone,
on the night after the burial, I remembered a poem written
on the death of Yeats by his friend Auden, and felt as if it
was written for my father:
Earth, receive an honoured guest;
William Yeats is laid to rest:
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In the prison of his daysTeach the
free man how to praise.
In worldly terms, it was the death of just another old man.
No public mourning was organized, no flags were lowered
to half-mast, no newspaper carried an obituary for him. He
was not a politician, a scholar, or a businessman. He was a
plain and transparent man. My father pursued the supreme
value, the Good. His life inspired the growth of all that was
benign and angelic, wise and noble.
My father had always reminded me of the legendary
Abou Ben Adhem who, waking one night from a deep
dream of peace, saw an angel writing in a book of gold the
names of those who love the Lord. Abou asked the Angel if
his own name was on the list. The Angel replied in the
negative. Disappointed but still cheerful, Abou said, “Write
my name down as one that loves his fellowmen”. The angel
wrote, and vanished. The next night, it came again with a
great wakening light, and showed the names of those
whom the love of God had blessed. And Abou’s name was
the first on the list.
I sat for a long time with my mother, but could not speak.
She blessed me in a choked voice when I took leave of her
to return to Thumba. She knew that she was not to leave the
house of her husband, of which she was the custodian, and
I was not to live with her there. Both of us had to live out our
own destinies. Was I too stubborn or was I excessively
preoccupied with the SLV? Should I not have forgotten for a
while my own affairs in order to listen to her? I regretfully
realised this only when she passed away soon afterwards.
The SLV-3 Apogee rocket, developed as a common
upper stage with Diamont, scheduled to be flight tested in
France was mired in a series of knotty problems. I had to
rush to France to sort them out. Before I could depart, late
in the afternoon, I was informed that my mother had passed
away. I took the first available bus to Nagarcoil. From there,
I travelled to Rameswaram spending a whole night in the
train and performed the last rites the next morning. Both the
people who had formed me had left for their heavenly
abode. The departed had reached the end of their journey.
The rest of us had to continue walking the weary road and
life had to go on. I prayed in the mosque my father had
once taken me to every evening. I told Him that my mother
could not have lived longer in the world without the care and
love of her husband, and therefore had preferred to join
him. I begged His forgiveness. “They carried out the task I
designed for them with great care, dedication and honesty
and came back to me. Why are you mourning their day of
accomplishment? Concentrate on the assignments that lie
before you, and proclaim my glory through your deeds!”
Nobody had said these words, but I heard them loud and
clear. An inspiring aphorism in the Qur’an on the passing
away of souls filled my mind: “Your wealth and children are
only a temptation whereas: Allah! with Him is an eternal
award.” I came out of the mosque with my mind at peace
and proceeded to the railway station. I always remember
that when the call for namaz sounded, our home would
transform into a small mosque. My father and my mother
leading, and their children and grandchildren following.
The next morning I was back at Thumba, physically
exhausted, emotionally shattered, but determined to fulfill
our ambition of flying an Indian rocket motor on foreign soil.
On my return from France, after successfully testing the
SLV-3 apogee motor, Dr Brahm Prakash informed me one
day about the arrival of Wernher von Braun. Everybody
working in rocketry knows of von Braun, who made the
lethal V-2 missiles that devastated London in the Second
World War. In the final stages of the War, von Braun was
captured by the Allied Forces. As a tribute to his genius,
von Braun was given a top position in the rocketry
programme at NASA. Working for the US Army, von Braun
produced the landmark Jupiter missile, which was the first
IRBM with a 3000 km range. When I was asked by Dr
Brahm Prakash to receive von Braun at Madras and escort
him to Thumba, I was naturally excited.
The V-2 missile (an abbreviation of the German word
Vergeltungswaffe) was by far the greatest single
achievement in the history of rockets and missiles. It was
the culmination of the efforts made by von Braun and his
team in the VFR (Society for Space Flight) in the 1920s.
What had begun as a civilian effort soon became an official
army one, and von Braun became the technical director of
the German Missile Laboratory at Kummersdorf. The first
V-2 missile was first tested unsuccessfully in June 1942. It
toppled over on to its side and exploded. But on 16 August
1942, it became the first missile to exceed the speed of
sound. Under the supervision of von Braun, more than
10,000 V-2 missiles were produced between April and
October 1944 at the gigantic underground production unit
near Nordhausen in Germany. That I would be travelling
with this man—a scientist, a designer, a production
engineer, an administrator, a technology manager all rolled
into one—what more could I have asked for?
We flew in an Avro aircraft which took around ninety
minutes from Madras to Trivandrum. von Braun asked me
about our work and listened as if he was just another
student of rocketry. I never expected the father of modern
rocketry to be so humble, receptive and encouraging. He
made me feel comfortable right through the flight. It was
hard to imagine that I was talking to a giant of missile
systems, as he was so self-effacing.
He observed that the length to diameter L/D ratio of the
SLV3, which was designed to be 22 was on the higher side
and cautioned me about the aero-elastic problems which
must be avoided during flight.
Having spent the major part of his working life in
Germany, how did he feel in America? I asked this of von
Braun who had become a cult figure in the States after
creating the Saturn rocket in the Apollo mission which put
man on the moon. “America is a country of great
possibilities, but they look upon everything un-American
with suspicion and contempt. They suffer from a deep-
rooted NIH—Not Invented Here—complex and look down
on alien technologies. If you want to do anything in rocketry,
do it yourself,” von Braun advised me. He commented,
“SLV-3 is a genuine Indian design and you may be having
your own troubles. But you should always remember that we
don’t just build on successes, we also build on failures.”
On the topic of the inevitable hard work that goes with
rocket development and the degree of commitment
involved, he smiled and said with a glint of mischief in his
eyes, “Hard work is not enough in rocketry. It is not a sport
where mere hard work can fetch you honours. Here, not
only do you have to have a goal but you have to have
strategies to achieve it as fast as possible.”
“Total commitment is not just hard work, it is total
involvement. Building a rock wall is back-breaking work.
There are some people who build rock walls all their lives.
And when they die, there are miles of walls, mute
testimonials to how hard those people had worked.”
He continued, “But there are other men who while
placing one rock on top of another have a vision in their
minds, a goal. It may be a terrace with roses climbing over
the rock walls and chairs set out for lazy summer days. Or
the rock wall may enclose an apple orchard or mark a
boundary. When they finish, they have more than a wall. It is
the goal that makes the difference. Do not make rocketry
your profession, your livelihood— make it your religion, your
mission.” Did I see something of Prof. Vikram Sarabhai in
von Braun? It made me happy to think so.
With three deaths in the family in as many successive
years, I needed total commitment to my work in order to
keep performing. I wanted to throw all my being into the
creation of the SLV. I felt as if I had discovered the path I
was meant to follow, God’s mission for me and my purpose
on His earth. During this period, it was as though I had
pushed a hold button—no badminton in the evenings, no
more weekends or holidays, no family, no relations, not
even any friends outside the SLV circle.
To succeed in your mission, you must have single-
minded devotion to your goal. Individuals like myself are
often called ‘workaholics’. I question this term because that
implies a pathological condition or an illness. If I do that
which I desire more than anything else in the world and
which makes me happy, such work can never be an
aberration. Words from the twenty-sixth Psalm come to
mind while I work: “Examine me, O Lord, and prove me.”
Total commitment is a crucial quality for those who want
to reach the very top of their profession. The desire to work
at optimum capacity leaves hardly any room for anything
else. I have had people with me who would scoff at the 40-
hours-a-week job they were being paid for. I have known
others who used to work 60, 80 and even 100 hours a
week because they found their work exciting and
rewarding. Total commitment is the common denominator
among all successful men and women. Are you able to
manage the stresses you encounter in your life? The
difference between an energetic and a confused person is
the difference in the way their minds handle their
experiences. Man needs his difficulties because they are
necessary to enjoy success. All of us carry some sort of a
super-intelligence within us. Let it be stimulated to enable
us to examine our deepest thoughts, desires, and beliefs.
Once you have done this—charged yourself, as it were,
with your commitment to your work—you also need good
health and boundless energy. Climbing to the top demands
strength, whether to the top of Mount Everest or to the top of
your career. People are born with different energy reserves
and the one who tires first and burns out easily will do well
to reorganize his or her life at the earliest.
In 1979, a six-member team was preparing the flight
version of a complex second stage control system for static
test and evaluation. The team was in countdown mode at T-
15 minutes (15 minutes before the test). One of the twelve
valves did not respond during checkout. Anxiety drove the
members of the team to the test site to look into the
problem. Suddenly the oxidizer tank, filled with red fuming
nitric acid (RFNA), burst, causing severe acid burns to the
team members. It was a very traumatic experience to see
the suffering of the injured. Kurup and I rushed to the
Trivandrum Medical College Hospital and begged to have
our colleagues admitted, as six beds were not available in
the hospital at that point of time.
Sivaramakrishnan Nair was one among the six persons
injured. The acid had burned his body at a number of
places. By the time we got a bed in the hospital, he was in
severe pain. I kept vigil at his bedside. Around 3 o’ clock in
the morning, Sivarama-krishnan regained consciousness.
His first words expressed regret over the mishap and
assured me that he would make up the slippage in
schedules caused by the accident. His sincerity and
optimism, even in the midst of such severe pain, impressed
me deeply.
Men like Sivaramakrishnan are a breed apart. They are
the strivers, always reaching higher than the last time. And
with their social and family life welded to their dream, they
find the rewards of their drive overwhelming—the inherent
joy of being in flow. This event greatly enhanced my
confidence in my team; a team that would stand like a rock
in success and failure.
I have used the word ‘flow’ at many places without really
elaborating its meaning. What is this flow? And what are
these joys? I could call them moments of magic. I see an
analogy between these moments and the high that you
experience when you play badminton or go jogging. Flow is
a sensation we experience when we act with total
involvement. During flow, action follows action according to
an internal logic that seems to need no conscious
intervention on the part of the worker. There is no hurry;
there are no distracting demands on one’s attention. The
past and the future disappear. So does the distinction
between self and the activity. We had all come under the
current of the SLV flow. Although we were working very
hard we were very relaxed, energetic and fresh. How did it
happen? Who had created this flow?
Perhaps it was the meaningful organization of the
purposes we sought to achieve. We would identify the
broadest possible purpose level and then work towards
developing a feasible target solution from a variety of
alternatives. It was this working backwards to develop a
creative change in the problem solution, that used to put us
in ‘flow’.
When the SLV-3 hardware started emerging, our ability
to concentrate increased markedly. I felt a tremendous
surge of confidence; in complete control over myself and
over the SLV-3 project. Flow is a by-product of controlled
creativity. The first requirement is to work as hard as you
can at something that presents a challenge and is
approved by your heart. It may not be an overwhelming
challenge, but one that stretches you a little, something that
makes you realise that you are performing a task better
today than you did yesterday, or the last time you tried to do
it. Another prerequisite for being in flow is the availability of
a significant span of uninterrupted time. In my experience, it
is difficult to switch into the flow state in less than half an
hour. And it is almost impossible if you are bedevilled by
interruptions.
Is it possible to switch yourself into flow by using some
sort of a conditioning device in much the same way that we
condition ourselves to learn effectively? The answer is yes,
and the secret is to analyse previous occasions when you
have been in flow, because each person has his or her
unique natural frequency which responds to a particular
stimulus. You alone can identify the common denominator
in your case. Once you have isolated this common
denominator, you can set the stage for flow.
I have experienced this state many times, almost every
day of the SLV mission. There have been days in the
laboratory when I have looked up to find the laboratory
empty and realised that it was way past the quitting time.
On other days, my team members and I have been so
caught up in our work that the lunch hour slipped by without
our even being conscious that we were hungry.
Analysing such occasions in retrospect, I find them
similar in the sense that this flow was experienced when the
project was nearing completion, or when the project had
reached that phase when all the necessary data had been
gathered and we were ready to start summing up the
problem, outlining the demands made by conflicting criteria
and the various positions presented by opposing interests
and making our recommendations for action. I also realised
that this tended to happen on days that were relatively quiet
in the office, with no crises or meetings. Such spells
increased steadily in frequency, and the SLV-3 dream was
finally realised in the middle of 1979.
We had scheduled the first experimental flight trial of
SLV-3 for 10 August 1979. The primary goals of the
mission were to realise a fully integrated launch vehicle; to
evaluate on-board systems like stage motors, guidance
and control systems and electronic subsystems; and to
evaluate ground systems, like checkout, tracking, telemetry
and real-time data facilities in launch operations built at the
Sriharikota launch complex. The 23 metre-long, four-stage
SLV rocket weighing 17 tonnes finally took off elegantly at
0758 hours and immediately started following its
programmed trajectory.
Stage I performed to perfection. There was a smooth
transition from this stage to the second stage. We were
spellbound to see our hopes flying in the form of the SLV-3.
Suddenly, the spell was broken. The second stage went out
of control. The flight was terminated after 317 seconds and
the vehicle’s remains, including my favourite fourth stage
with the payload splashed into the sea, 560 km off
Sriharikota.
The incident caused us profound disappointment. I felt a
strange mix of anger and frustration. Suddenly, I felt my legs
become so stiff that they ached. The problem was not with
my body; something was happening in my mind.
The premature death of my hovercraft Nandi, the
abandoning of the RATO, the abortion of the SLV-Diamont
fourth stage—all came alive in a flash, like a long-buried
Phoenix rising from its ashes. Over the years, I had
somehow learned to absorb these aborted endeavours,
had come to terms with them and pursued fresh dreams.
That day, I re-lived each of those setbacks in my deep
despondency.
“What do you suppose could be the cause of it?”
somebody asked me in the Block House. I tried to find an
answer, but I was too tired to try and think it out, and gave
up the effort as futile. The launch was conducted in the early
morning, preceded by a full night’s count-down. Moreover, I
had hardly had any sleep in the past week. Completely
drained—mentally as well as physically—I went straight to
my room and slumped onto the bed.
A gentle touch on my shoulder woke me up. It was late
in the afternoon, almost approaching evening. I saw Dr
Brahm Prakash sitting by my bedside. “What about going
for lunch?” he asked. I was deeply touched by his affection
and concern. I found out later that Dr Brahm Prakash had
come to my room twice before that but had gone away on
finding me asleep. He had waited all that time for me to get
up and have lunch with him. I was sad, but not alone. The
company of Dr Brahm Prakash filled me with a new
confidence. He made light conversation during the meal,
carefully avoiding the SLV-3, but gently providing me
solace.

Builders
Dr Brahm Prakash helped me endure this difficult
period. In practice, Dr Brahm Prakash employed the front-
line damage control principle: “Just get the fellow home
alive. He’ll recover.” He drew the entire SLV team close
and demonstrated to me that I was not alone in my sorrow
at the SLV-3’s failure. “All your comrades are standing by
you,” he said. This gave me vital emotional support,
encouragement, and guidance.
A post-flight review conducted on 11 August 1979 was
attended by more than seventy scientists. A detailed
technical appraisal of the failure was completed. Later, the
post-flight analysis committee headed by SK Athithan
pinpointed the reasons for the malfunction of the vehicle. It
was established that the mishap occurred because of the
failure of the second stage control system. No control force
was available during the second stage flight due to which
the vehicle became aerodynamically unstable, resulting in
altitude and velocity loss. This caused the vehicle to fall into
the sea even before the other stages could ignite.
Further in-depth analysis of the second-stage failure
identified the reason as the draining of a good amount of
Red Fuming Nitric Acid (RFNA) used as the oxidizer for the
fuel power at that stage. Consequently, when the control
force was demanded, only fuel was injected resulting in
zero force. ‘A solenoid valve in the oxidizer tank remaining
open due to contamination after the first command at T-8
minutes’, was identified as the reason for the draining of
RFNA.
The findings were presented to Prof. Dhawan at a
meeting of top ISRO scientists and were accepted.
Everybody was convinced by the technical cause-and-
effect sequence presented and there was a general feeling
of satisfaction about the whole exercise of failure-
management measures taken. I was still unconvinced
though and felt restless. To me, the level of responsibility is
measured by one’s ability to confront the decision-making
process without any delay or distraction.
On the spur of the moment, I stood up and addressed
Prof. Dhawan, “Sir, even though my friends have technically
justified the failure, I take the responsibility for judging the
RFNA leak detected during the final phase of countdown as
insignificant. As a Mission Director, I should have put the
launch on hold and saved the flight if possible. In a similar
situation abroad, the Mission Director would have lost his
job. I therefore take responsibility for the SLV-3 failure.” For
quite some time there was pin-drop silence in the hall. Then
Prof. Dhawan got up and said, “I am going to put Kalam in
orbit!”, and left the place signalling that the meeting was
over.
The pursuit of science is a combination of great elation
and great despair. I went over many such episodes in my
mind. Johannes Kepler, whose three orbital laws form the
basis of space research, took nearly 17 years after
formulating the two laws about planetary motion around the
sun, to enunciate his third law which gives the relation
between the size of the elliptical orbit and the length of time
it takes for the planet to go around the sun. How many
failures and frustrations must he have gone through? The
idea that man could land on the moon, developed by the
Russian mathematician Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, was
realised after nearly four decades—and by the United
States, at that. Prof. Chandrasekhar had to wait nearly 50
years before receiving the Nobel Prize for his discovery of
the ‘Chandrasekhar Limit’, a discovery made while he was
a graduate student at Cambridge in the 1930s. If his work
had been recognized then, it could have led to the
discovery of the Black Hole decades earlier. How many
failures must von Braun have gone through before his
Saturn launch vehicle put man on the moon? These
thoughts helped to give me the ability to withstand
apparently irreversible setbacks.
Early in November 1979, Dr Brahm Prakash retired. He
had always been my sheet-anchor in the turbulent waters of
VSSC. His belief in team spirit had inspired the
management pattern for the SLV project, which later
became a blueprint for all scientific projects in the country.
Dr Brahm Prakash was a very wise counsellor who gave
me valuable guidance whenever I deviated from my
mission objectives.
Dr Brahm Prakash not only reinforced the traits which I
had acquired from Prof. Sarabhai, but also helped me give
them new dimensions. He always cautioned me against
haste. “Big scientific projects are like mountains, which
should be climbed with as little effort as possible and
without urgency. The reality of your own nature should
determine your speed. If you become restless, speed up. If
you become tense and highstrung, slow down. You should
climb the mountain in a state of equilibrium. When each
task of your project is not just a means to an end but a
unique event in itself, then you are doing it well,” he would
tell me. The echo of Dr Brahm Prakash’s advice could be
heard in Emerson’s poem on Brahma:
If the red slayer think he slays,
Or, if the slain think he is slain,
They know not well, the subtle ways
I keep, and pass, and turn again.
To live only for some unknown future is superficial. It is
like climbing a mountain to reach the peak without
experiencing its sides. The sides of the mountain sustain
life, not the peak. This is where things grow, experience is
gained, and technologies are mastered. The importance of
the peak lies only in the fact that it defines the sides. So I
went on towards the top, but always experiencing the sides.
I had a long way to go but I was in no hurry. I went in little
steps—just one step after another—but each step towards
the top.
At every stage, the SLV-3 team was blessed with some
extraordinarily courageous people. Along with Sudhakar
and Sivaramakrishnan, there was also Sivakaminathan. He
was entrusted with bringing the C-Band transponder from
Trivandrum to SHAR for integration with the SLV-3. The
transponder is a device fitted with the rocket system to give
the radar signals which are powerful enough to help it track
the vehicle from the take-off site to the final impact point.
The SLV-3 launch schedule was dependent on the arrival
and integration of this equipment. On landing at the Madras
airport, the aircraft which Sivakami was travelling in
skidded and overshot the runway. Dense smoke engulfed
the aircraft. Everyone jumped out of the aircraft through
emergency exits, and desperately fought to save
themselves—all except Sivakami, who stayed in the aircraft
till he removed the transponder from his baggage. He was
among the last few persons, the others being mostly aircraft
crew, to emerge from the smoke and he was hugging the
transponder close to his chest.
Another incident from those days that I recall clearly
relates to Prof. Dhawan’s visit to the SLV-3 assembly
building. Prof. Dhawan, Madhavan Nair and I were
discussing some finer aspects of the SLV-3 integration.
The vehicle was kept on the launcher in a horizontal
position. When we were moving around and examining the
readiness of the integrated hardware, I noticed the
presence of big water-ports for extinguishing fire in case of
an accident. For some reason, I felt uncomfortable at the
sight of the ports facing the SLV-3 on the launcher. I
suggested to Madhavan Nair that we could rotate the port
so that they were apart by a full 180o. This would prevent
the freak possibility of water gushing out and damaging the
rocket. To our surprise, within minutes of Madhavan Nair
getting the ports reversed, powerful water jets gushed out
of the ports. The Vehicle Safety Officer had ensured the
functioning of the fire-fighting system without realising that it
could have wrecked the entire rocket. This was a lesson in
foresight. Or did we have divine protection?
On 17 July 1980, 30 hours before the launch of the
second SLV-3, the newspapers were filled with all kinds of
predictions. One of the newspapers reported, “The Project
Director is missing and could not be contacted.” Many
reports preferred to trace the history of the first SLV3 flight,
and recalled how the third stage had failed to ignite
because of lack of fuel and the rocket had nosedived into
the ocean. Some highlighted SLV-3’s possible military
implications in terms of acquiring the capability for building
IRBMs. Some were a general prognosis of all that ailed our
country and related it to the SLV-3. I knew that the next
day’s launch was going to decide the future of the Indian
space programme. In fact, to put it simply, the eyes of the
whole nation were on us.
In the early hours of the next day, 18 July 1980—at 0803
hrs to be precise, India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle,
SLV-3 lifted off from SHAR. At 600 seconds before take-
off, I saw the computer displaying data about stage IV
giving the required velocity to the Rohini Satellite (carried
as payload) to enter its orbit. Within the next two minutes,
Rohini was set into motion in a low earth orbit. I spoke, in
the midst of screeching decibels, the most important words
I had ever uttered in my life, “Mission Director calling all
stations. Stand by for an important announcement. All
stages performed to mission requirements. The fourth
stage apogee motor has given the required velocity to put
Rohini Satellite into orbit”. There were happy cries
everywhere. When I came out of the Block House, I was
lifted onto the shoulders of my jubilant colleagues and
carried in a procession.
The whole nation was excited. India had made its entry
into the small group of nations which possessed satellite
launch capability. Newspapers carried news of the event in
their headlines. Radio and television stations aired special
programmes. Parliament greeted the achievement with the
thumping of desks. It was both the culmination of a national
dream, and the beginning of a very important phase in our
nation’s history. Prof. Satish Dhawan, Chairman ISRO,
threw his customary guardedness to the winds and
announced that it was now well within our ability to explore
space. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi cabled her
congratulations. But the most important reaction was that of
the Indian scientific community—everybody was proud of
this hundred per cent indigenous effort.
I experienced mixed feelings. I was happy to achieve
the success which had been evading me for the past two
decades, but I was sad because the people who had
inspired me were no longer there to share my joy—my
father, my brother-in-law Jallaluddin, and Prof. Sarabhai.
The credit for the successful SLV-3 flight goes, first, to
the giants of the Indian space programme, Prof. Sarabhai
in particular, who had preceded this effort; next to the
hundreds of VSSC personnel who had through sheer will-
power proved the mettle of our countrymen and also, not
least, to Prof. Dhawan and Dr Brahm Prakash, who had led
the project.
We had a late dinner that evening. Gradually, the din
and clatter of the celebrations calmed down. I retired to my
bed with almost no energy left. Through the open window, I
could see the moon among the clouds. The sea breeze
seemed to reflect the buoyancy of the mood on Sriharikota
island that day.
Within a month of the SLV-3 success, I visited the Nehru
Science Centre in Bombay for a day, in response to an
invitation to share my experiences with the SLV-3. There, I
received a telephone call from Prof. Dhawan in Delhi,
asking me to join him the next morning. We were to meet
the Prime Minister, Mrs Indira Gandhi. My hosts at the
Nehru Centre were kind enough to arrange my ticket to
Delhi, but I had a small problem. It had to do with my
clothes. I was dressed casually as is my wont and wearing
slippers—not, by any standards of etiquette, suitable attire
in which to meet the Prime Minister! When I told Prof.
Dhawan about this problem, he told me not to worry about
my dress. “You are beautifully clothed in your success,” he
quipped.
Prof. Dhawan and I arrived at the Parliament House
Annexe the next morning. A meeting of the Parliamentary
Panel on Science & Technology chaired by the Prime
Minister was scheduled. There were about 30 Members of
the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha in the room, which was lit
by a majestic chandelier. Prof. MGK Menon and Dr Nag
Chaudhuri were also present. Shrimati Gandhi spoke to the
Members about the success of the SLV-3 and lauded our
achievement. Prof. Dhawan thanked the gathering for the
encouragement given by them to space research in the
country and expressed the gratitude of the ISRO scientists
and engineers. Suddenly, I saw Shrimati Gandhi smiling at
me as she said, “Kalam! We would like to hear you speak.”
I was surprised by the request as Prof. Dhawan had
already addressed the gathering.
Hesitantly, I rose and responded, “I am indeed
honoured to be in this great gathering of nation-builders. I
only know how to build a rocket system in our country, which
would inject a satellite, built in our country, by imparting to it
a velocity of 25,000 km per hour.” There was thunderous
applause. I thanked the members for giving us an
opportunity to work on a project like the SLV-3 and prove
the scientific strength of our country. The entire room was
irradiated with happiness.
Now that Project SLV-3 had been successfully
completed, VSSC had to re-organize its resources and
redefine its goals. I wanted to be relieved of the project
activities, and consequently Ved Prakash Sandlas from my
team was made the Project Director for the SLV-3
Continuation Project, which aimed at making operational
satellite launch vehicles of a similar class. With a view to
upgrade the SLV-3 by means of certain technological
innovations, the development of Augmented Satellite
Launch Vehicles (ASLVs) had been on the cards for some
time. The aim was to enhance the SLV-3 payload
capability from 40 kg to 150 kg. MSR Dev from my team
was appointed Project Director ASLV. Then, to reach the
sun-synchronous orbit (900 km), a PSLV was to be made.
The Geo Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) was also
envisaged, though as a distant dream. I took up the
position of Director, Aerospace Dynamics and Design
Group, so that I could configure the forthcoming launch
vehicles and technology development.
The existing VSSC infrastructure was inadequate to
handle the size and weight of the future launch vehicle
systems and the implementation of all these projects was
going to require highly specialized facilities. New sites
were identified for the expanded activities of VSSC, at
Vattiyoorkavu and Valiamala. Dr Srinivasan drew up a
detailed plan of the facilities. Meanwhile, I carried out an
analysis of the application of SLV-3 and its variants with
Sivathanu Pillai, and compared the existing launch vehicles
of the world for missile applications. We established that
the SLV-3 solid rocket systems would meet the national
requirements of payload delivery vehicles for short and
intermediate ranges (4000 km). We contended that the
development of one additional solid booster of 1.8 m
diameter with 36 tonnes of propellant along with SLV-3
subsystems would meet the ICBM requirement (above
5000 km for a 1000 kg payload). This proposal was,
however, never considered. It nevertheless paved the way
for the formulation of the Re-entry Experiment (REX) which,
much later on, became Agni.
The next SLV-3 flight, SLV3-D1, took off on 31 May
1981. I witnessed this flight from the visitors’ gallery. This
was the first time I witnessed a launch from outside the
Control Centre. The unpalatable truth I had to face was that
by becoming the focus of media attention, I had aroused
envy among some of my senior colleagues, all of whom had
equally contributed to the success of SLV-3. Was I hurt at
the coldness of the new environment? Perhaps yes, but I
was willing to accept what I couldn’t change.
I have never lived off the profits of others’ minds. My life,
in keeping with my nature, has never been that of a ruthless
achiever. The SLV-3 was made not by force and
manipulation, but through consistent collective effort. Then
why this sense of bitterness? Was it peculiar to the VSSC
top level or a universal reality? As a scientist, I was trained
to reason out reality. In science, reality is that which exists.
And because this bitterness was real, I had to reason it out.
But can these things be reasoned out?
Were my post-SLV experiences leading me into a
critical situation? Yes and no. Yes, because the glory of
SLV-3 had not gone to everyone who deserved it—but
hardly anything could have been done about that. No,
because a situation can be considered critical for a person
only when realisation of the internal necessity becomes
impossible. And that certainly was not the case. In fact, the
concept of conflict is built upon this basic idea. In
retrospect, I can only say that I was fully aware of a great
need for actualization and renewal.
In January 1981, I was invited by Dr Bhagiratha Rao of
the High Altitude Laboratory (now the Defence Electronics
Applications Laboratory (DEAL)), Dehra Dun to give a
lecture on the SLV-3. The renowned nuclear scientist, Prof.
Raja Ramanna, whom I had always admired, and who was
then the Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister,
presided over the gathering. He spoke on India’s efforts in
generating nuclear energy and the challenge in conducting
the first nuclear test for peaceful purposes. As I had been
so closely involved with SLV-3, it was natural that I was
soon in full spate about it. Later, Prof. Raja Ramanna
invited me for a private meeting over tea.
The first thing that struck me when I met Prof. Ramanna
was his genuine pleasure at meeting me. There was an
eagerness in his talk, an immediate, sympathetic
friendliness, accompanied by quick, graceful movements.
The evening brought back memories of my first meeting
with Prof. Sarabhai—as if it was yesterday. The world of
Prof. Sarabhai was internally simple and externally easy.
Each of us working with him was driven by a single-minded
need to create, and lived under conditions which made the
object of that need directly accessible. Sarabhai’s world
was tailor-made to our dreams. It had neither too much nor
too little of anything needed by any one of us. We could
divide it by our requirements without a remainder.
My world, by now, had no simplicity left in it. It had
become an internally complex and externally difficult world.
My efforts in rocketry and in achieving the goal of making
indigenous rockets were impeded by external obstacles
and complicated by internal wavering. I was aware that it
required a special effort of the will to sustain my trajectory.
The coordination of my present with my past had already
been jeopardised. The coordination of my present with my
future was uppermost in my mind when I went to have tea
with Prof. Ramanna.
He did not take long to come to the point. The Devil
Missile programme had been shelved in spite of
tremendous achievements made by Narayanan and his
team at DRDL. The entire programme of military rockets
was reeling under a persistent apathy. The DRDO needed
somebody to take command of their missile programmes
which had been stuck at the drawing board and static test
bed stages for quite a while. Prof. Ramanna asked me if I
would like to join DRDL and shoulder the responsibility of
shaping their Guided Missile Development Programme
(GMDP). Prof. Ramanna’s proposal evoked a mixture of
emotions in me.
When again would I have such an opportunity to
consolidate all our knowledge of rocketry and apply it?
I felt honoured by the esteem in which Prof. Ramanna
held me. He had been the guiding spirit behind the
Pokharan nuclear test, and I was thrilled by the impact he
had helped create on the outside world about India’s
technical competence. I knew I would not be able to refuse
him. Prof. Ramanna advised me to talk to Prof. Dhawan on
this issue so that he could work out the modalities of my
transfer from ISRO to DRDL.
I met Prof. Dhawan on 14 January 1981. He gave me a
patient hearing, with his typical penchant for weighing
everything carefully to make sure he didn’t miss a point. A
markedly pleasant expression came to his face. He said, “I
am pleased with their appraisal of my man’s work”. He then
smiled. I have never met anyone with a smile quite like Prof.
Dhawan’s—a soft white cloud—you could picture it in any
shape you wanted to.
I wondered how I should proceed. “Should I formally
apply for the post so that DRDL could send the
appointment order?” I enquired of Prof. Dhawan. “No. Don’t
pressurise them. Let me talk to the top-level management
during my next visit to New Delhi,” Prof. Dhawan said. “I
know you have always had one foot in DRDO, now your
whole centre of gravity seems to have shifted towards
them.” Perhaps what Prof. Dhawan was telling me had an
element of truth in it, but my heart had always been at ISRO.
Was he really unaware of that?
Republic Day, 1981 brought with it a pleasant surprise.
On the evening of 25 January, Mahadevan, Secretary to
Prof. UR Rao, rang up from Delhi to inform me about the
Home Ministry announcement about the conferment of the
Padma Bhushan award on me. The next important call was
from Prof. Dhawan to congrat-ulate me. I felt blissfully
elated as it was from my guru. I rejoiced with Prof. Dhawan
at his receiving the Padma Vibhushan and I congratulated
him wholeheartedly. I then rang up Dr Brahm Prakash and
thanked him. Dr Brahm Prakash chided me for the formality
and said, “I feel as if my son has got the award.” I was so
deeply touched by Dr Brahm Prakash’s affection that I
could no longer keep my emotions in check.
I filled my room with the music of Bismillah Khan’s
shehnai. The music took me to another time, another place.
I visited Rameswaram and hugged my mother. My father
ran his caring fingers through my hair. My mentor,
Jallaluddin, announced the news to the crowd gathered on
Mosque Street. My sister, Zohara, prepared special sweets
for me. Pakshi Lakshmana Sastry put a tilak on my
forehead. Fr. Solomon blessed me holding the holy cross. I
saw Prof. Sarabhai smiling with a sense of achievement—
the sapling which he had planted twenty years ago had
finally grown into a tree whose fruits were being
appreciated by the people of India.
My Padma Bhushan evoked mixed reactions at VSSC.
While there were some who shared my happiness, there
were others who felt I was being unduly singled out for
recognition. Some of my close associates turned envious.
Why do some people fail to see the great values of life
because of sadly twisted thought processes? Happiness,
satisfaction, and success in life depend on making the right
choices, the winning choices. There are forces in life
working for you and against you. One must distinguish the
beneficial forces from the malevolent ones and choose
correctly between them.
An inner voice told me that the time had come for a long
felt, but ignored, need for renewal. Let me clean my slate
and write new ‘sums’. Were the earlier sums done
correctly? Evaluating one’s own progress in life is not an
easy task. Here the student has to set his own questions,
seek his own answers and evaluate them to his own
satisfaction. Judgement aside, eighteen years at ISRO was
too long a stay to leave without pain. As for my afflicted
friends, the lines by Lewis Carroll seemed very
appropriate:
You may charge me with murder –
Or want of sense
(We are all of us weak at times):
But the slightest approach to a false pretence
Was never among my crimes!

PROPITIATION
[ 1981 – 1991 ]
Let craft, ambition, spite,
Be quenched in Reason’s night, Till weakness turn to
might,
Till what is dark be light,
Till what is wrong be right!

Seekers
A
minor tussle over my services occurred at this time,
between ISRO, which was a little hesitant to relieve me, and
DRDO, which wanted to take me in. Many months went by,
and
many letters were exchanged between ISRO and
DRDO; and meetings were held in the secretariats of the
Defence R&D establishment and the Department of Space
to precipitate a mutually convenient course of action.
Meanwhile, Prof. Ramanna retired from the office of the
Scientific 
Advisor 
to 
Defence 
Minister. 
Dr 
VS
Arunachalam, till then Director of the Defence Metallurgical
Research Laboratory (DMRL) in Hyderabad, succeeded
Prof. Ramanna. Dr Arunachalam was known for his
confidence, and he cared little for the intricacies and
nuances of the scientific bureaucracy. Meanwhile, I
understand that the Defence Minister at that time, R
Venkataraman discussed the matter of my taking over the
missile laboratory with Prof. Dhawan. Prof. Dhawan also
seemed to be waiting for a decisive step at the highest
level in the Defence Ministry. Overcoming the niggling
doubts that had caused delays over the past year, the
decision to appoint me Director, DRDL was finally taken in
February, 1982.
Prof. Dhawan used to visit my room in the ISRO
headquarters and spend many hours in evolving space
launch vehicle projects. It was a great privilege to work with
such a great scientist. Before I left ISRO, Prof. Dhawan
asked me to give a talk on the Space Programme Profile in
India by the year 2000. Almost the entire ISRO
management and staff attended my talk, which was by way
of a farewell meeting.
I had met Dr VS Arunachalam in 1976, when I visited
DMRL in connection with the aluminium alloy investment
casting for the SLV inertial guidance platform. Taking it as
a personal challenge, Dr Arunachalam had the investment
casting, the first of its kind in the country, made in the
incredibly short time of two months. His youthful energy and
enthusiasm never failed to amaze me. This young
metallurgist had within a short span of time lifted the
science of metal-making to the technology of metal-forming
and then to the art of alloy development. With a tall and
elegant figure, Dr Arunachalam was like an electrically
charged dynamo himself. I found him an unusually friendly
person with a forceful manner, as well as an excellent
working partner.
I visited DRDL in April 1982 to acquaint myself with my
potential work site. The Director of DRDL then, SL Bansal,
took me around and introduced me to the senior scientists
in the laboratory. DRDL was working on five staff projects
and sixteen competence build-up projects. They were also
involved in several technology-oriented activities with a
view to gain lead time for the development of indigenous
missile systems in future. I was particularly impressed by
their efforts on the twin 30-ton Liquid Propellant Rocket
Engine.
Meanwhile, Anna University, Madras, conferred the
honorary degree of Doctor of Science on me. It had been
nearly twenty years since I had acquired my degree in
aeronautical engineering. I was happy that Anna University
had recognized my efforts in the field of rocketry, but what
pleased me most was the recognition of the value of our
work in academic circles. To my delight, the honorary
doctorate degree was awarded at a convocation presided
over by Prof. Raja Ramanna.
I joined DRDL on 1 June, 1982. Very soon, I realized
that this laboratory was still haunted by the winding up of the
Devil missile project. Many excellent professionals had not
yet recovered from the disappointment. People outside the
scientific world may find it difficult to comprehend how a
scientist feels when the umbilical cord to his work is
suddenly snapped, for reasons totally alien to his
understanding and interests. The general mood and work
tempo at DRDL reminded me of Samuel Taylor
Coleridge’s poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner:
Day after day, day after day,
We stuck, nor breath, nor motion;
As idle as a painted ship
Upon a painted ocean.
I found almost all my senior colleagues living with the
pain of dashed hopes. There was a widespread feeling that
the scientists of this laboratory had been cheated by the
senior officials in the Ministry of Defence. It was clear to me
that the burial of the Devil was essential for the rise of hope
and vision.
When about a month later, Admiral OS Dawson, then
the Chief of Naval Staff, visited DRDL, I used it as an
opportunity to make a point with my team. The Tactical
Core Vehicle (TCV) project had been hanging fire for quite
some time. It was conceived as a single core vehicle with
certain common subsystems to meet the requirements of
the services for a quick reaction Surface-to-Air Missile, an
anti-radiation Air-to-Surface Missile which could be
launched from helicopters or fixed wing aircraft. I
emphasized the sea-skimming role of the core vehicle to
Admiral Dawson. I focussed not on its technical intricacies,
but on its battlefield capabilities; and I highlighted the
production plans. The message was loud and clear to my
new associates—do not make anything which you cannot
sell later and do not spend your life on making one thing
only. Missile development is a multi-dimensional business
—if you remain in any one dimension for a long time, you
will get stuck.
My initial few months at DRDL were largely interactive. I
had read at St. Joseph’s that an electron may appear as a
particle or wave depending on how you look at it. If you ask
a particle question, it will give you a particle answer; if you
ask a wave question, it will give you a wave answer. I not
only described and explained our goals, but also made
them an interplay between our work and ourselves. I still
recall quoting Ronald Fischer at one of the meetings, “The
sweetness we taste in a piece of sugar is neither a
property of the sugar nor a property of ourselves. We are
producing the experience of sweetness in the process of
interacting with the sugar.”
Very good work on a Surface-to-Surface missile with a
vertical riseturn straight line climb-ballistic path had been
done by that time. I was astonished to see the
determination of the DRDL workforce, who, in spite of the
premature winding up of their earlier projects, were eager
to go ahead. I arranged reviews for its various subsystems,
to arrive at precise specifications. To the horror of many
old-timers in DRDO, I started inviting people from the Indian
Institute of Science, Indian Institutes of Technology, Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research, Tata Institute of
Fundamental Research, and many other educational
institutions where related experts could be found. I felt that
the stuffy work centres of DRDL needed a breath of fresh
air. Once we opened the windows wide, the light of
scientific talent began to pour in. Once more, Coleridge’s
Ancient Mariner came to mind: “Swiftly, swiftly flew the
ship,\ Riding gently the oncoming tide.”
Sometime in the beginning of 1983, Prof. Dhawan
visited DRDL. I reminded him of his own advice to me
almost a decade ago: “You have to dream before your
dreams can come true. Some people stride towards
whatever it is that they want in life; others shuffle their feet
and never get started because they do not know what they
want—and do not know how to find it either.” ISRO was
lucky to have had Prof. Sarabhai and Prof. Dhawan at the
helm—leaders who elucidated their goals, made their
missions larger than their lives, and could then inspire their
entire workforce. DRDL had not been so lucky. This
excellent laboratory played a truncated role that did not
reflect its existing or potential capabilities or even fulfill the
expectations in South Block. I told Prof. Dhawan about the
highly professional, but slightly bewildered team I had. Prof.
Dhawan responded with his characteristic broad smile
which could be interpreted in any way one chose.
In order to accelerate the pace of R&D activities at
DRDL, it was imperative that decisions on vital scientific,
technical and technological problems be taken quickly.
Throughout my career I had zealously pursued openness in
scientific matters. I had seen from very close quarters the
decay and disintegration that go with management through
closed-door consultations and secret manipulations. I
always despised and resisted such efforts. So the first
major decision which we took was to create a forum of
senior scientists where important matters could be
discussed

and debated as a collective endeavour. Thus, a high
level body called the Missile Technology Committee was
formed within DRDL. The concept of management by
participation was evoked and earnest efforts were made to
involve middle-level scientists and engineers in the
management activities of the laboratory.
Days of debate and weeks of thinking finally culminated
in the longterm ‘Guided Missile Development Programme’.
I had read somewhere, “Know where you are going. The
great thing in the world is not knowing so much where we
stand, as in what direction we are moving.” What if we did
not have the technological might of the Western countries,
we knew we had to attain that might, and this determination
was our driving force. To draw up a clear and well-defined
missile development programme for the production of
indigenous missiles, a committee was constituted under
my chairmanship. The members were ZP Marshall, then the
Chief of Bharat Dynamics Limited, Hyderabad, NR Iyer, AK
Kapoor and KS Venkataraman. We drafted a paper for the
perusal of the Cabinet Committee for Political Affairs
(CCPA). The paper was given its final shape after
consulting the representatives of the three Defence
Services. We estimated an expenditure of about Rs 390
crores, spread over a period of twelve years.
Development programmes often get stuck by the time
they reach the production stage, mainly because of lack of
funding. We wanted to get funds to develop and produce
two missiles—a low-level quick reaction Tactical Core
Vehicle and a Medium Range Surface-to-Surface Weapon
System. We planned to make a surface-to-air medium
range weapon system with multi-target handling capability
during the second phase. DRDL had been known for its
pioneering work in the field of anti-tank missiles. We
proposed to develop a third generation anti-tank guided
missile having ‘fire-and-forget’ capabilities. All my
colleagues were pleased with the proposal. They saw an
opportunity to pursue afresh activities initiated long ago.
But I was not entirely satisfied. I longed to revive my buried
dream of a Re-entry Experiment Launch Vehicle (REX). I
persuaded my colleagues to take up a technology
development project to generate data for use in the design
of heat shields. These shields were required for building up
capability to make longrange missiles in the future.
I made a presentation in the South Block. The
presentation was presided over by the Defence Minister of
the time R Venkataraman, and attended by the three
Service Chiefs: General Krishna Rao, Air Chief Marshal
Dilbagh Singh and Admiral Dawson. The Cabinet
Secretary, Krishna Rao Sahib, Defence Secretary, SM
Ghosh and Secretary, Expenditure, R Ganapathy were
present. Everyone seemed to have all sorts of doubts—
about our capabilities, about the feasibility and availability
of required technological infrastructure, about the viability,
the schedule and cost. Dr Arunachalam stood by me like a
rock throughout the entire question-answer session.
Members were skeptical and apprehensive of drift—which
they felt was common among scientists. Although some
questioned our ambitious proposal, everyone, even the
doubting Thomases, were very excited about the idea of
India having her own missile systems. In the end, we were
asked by Defence Minister Venkataraman to meet him in
the evening, about three hours later.
We spent the intervening time working on permutations
and combinations. If they sanctioned only Rs 100 crores,
how would we allocate it? Suppose they gave us Rs 200
how would we allocate it? Suppose they gave us Rs 200
crores, then what would we do? When we met the Defence
Minister in the evening, I had a hunch we were going to get
some funds at any rate. But when he suggested that we
launch an integrated guided missile development
programme, instead of making missiles in phases, we
could not believe our ears.
We were quite dumbfounded by the Defence Minister’s
suggestion. After a long pause, Dr Arunachalam replied,
“We beg for time to rethink and return, Sir!” “You come
back tomorrow morning please,” the Defence Minister
replied. It was reminiscent of Prof. Sarabhai’s zeal and
vision. That night, Dr Arunachalam and I laboured together
on reworking our plan.
We worked out some very important extensions and
improvements in our proposal, taking all the variables, such
as design, fabrication, system integration, qualification,
experimental flights, evaluation, updating, user trials,
producibility, quality, reliability, and financial viability into
account. We then integrated them into a single function of
total accountability, in order to meet the needs of the
country’s armed forces with an indigenous endeavour. We
worked out the concepts of design, development,
production concurrency and proposed the participation of
user and inspection agencies right from the drawing-board
stage. We also suggested a methodology to achieve state-
of-the-art systems after all the years of developmental
activities. We wanted to deliver contemporary missiles to
our Services and not some outdated inventory of weapons.
It was a very exciting challenge that had been thrown to us.
By the time we finished our work, it was already
morning. Suddenly, at the breakfast table, I remembered
that I was to attend my niece Zameela’s wedding at
Rameswaram that evening. I thought it was already too late
to do anything. Even if I could catch the Madras flight later in
the day, how would I reach Rameswaram from there? There
was no air link between Madras and Madurai from where I
could board the evening train to Rameswaram. A pang of
guilt dampened my spirits. Was it fair, I asked myself, to
forget my family commitments and obligations? Zameela
was more like a daughter to me. The thought of missing her
wedding because of professional preoccupations at Delhi
was very distressing. I finished breakfast and left for the
meeting.
When we met Defence Minister Venkataraman and
showed him our revised proposal, he was visibly pleased.
The proposal of the missile development project had been
turned overnight into the blueprint of an integrated
programme with far-reaching consequences. It would have
wide-ranging technological spinoffs, and was exactly what
the Defence Minister had had in mind the previous evening.
Notwithstanding the great respect I had for the Defence
Minister, I was not really sure if he would clear our entire
proposal. But he did. I was absolutely delighted!
The Defence Minister stood up, signalling that the
meeting was over. Turning to me he said, “Since I brought
you here, I was expecting you to come up with something
like this. I am happy to see your work.” In a split second, the
mystery surrounding the clearance of my appointment as
Director DRDL in 1982 was cleared. So it was Defence
Minister Venkataraman who had brought me in! Bowing in
thanks, I turned towards the door when I heard Dr
Arunachalam telling the Minister about Zameela’s wedding
being scheduled for that evening at Rameswaram. It
amazed me that Dr Arunachalam should bring up this
matter before the Minister. Why would a person of his
stature, sitting in the all-powerful South Block, be
concerned about a wedding which was to take place on a
far-flung island in a small house on Mosque Street?
I have always had a high regard for Dr Arunachalam. He
has together with a command over language as he
displayed on this occasion, an uncanny presence of mind. I
was overwhelmed when the Defence Minister located an
Air Force helicopter doing sorties between Madras and
Madurai later in the day to take me to Madurai as soon as I
disembarked at Madras from the regular Indian Airlines
flight, which was leaving Delhi in an hour’s time. Dr
Arunachalam told me, “You have earned this for your hard
work of the last six months.”
Flying towards Madras, I scribbled on the back of my
boarding pass:
Who never climbed the weary league –
Can such a foot explore
The purple territories
On Rameswaram’s shore?
The Air Force helicopter landed close to the Indian
Airlines aircraft as soon as it arrived from Delhi. Within the
next few minutes I was on my way to Madurai. The Air
Force commandant there was kind enough to take me to
the railway station, where the train to Rameswaram was
just about to roll out of the platform. I was in Rameswaram
well in time for Zameela’s wedding. I blessed my brother’s
daughter with a father’s love.
The Defence Minister put up our proposal before the
Cabinet and saw it through. His recommendations on our
proposal were accepted and an unprecedented amount of
Rs 388 crores was sanctioned for this purpose. Thus was
born India’s prestigious Integrated Guided Missile
Development Programme, later abbreviated to IGMDP.
When I presented the government sanction letter before
the Missile Technology Committee at DRDL, they were
enthused with fire and action. The proposed projects were
christened in accordance with the spirit of India’s self-
reliance. Thus the Surface-to-Surface weapon system
became Prithvi (“the Earth”) and the Tactical Core Vehicle
was called Trishul (the trident of Lord Shiva). The Surface-
to-Air area defence system was named as Akash (“sky”)
and the anti-tank missile project Nag (“Cobra”). I gave the
name Agni (“Fire”) to my long cherished dream of REX. Dr
Arunachalam came to DRDL and formally launched the
IGMDP on 27 July 1983. It was a great event in which every
single employee of DRDL participated. Everybody who
was somebody in Indian Aerospace Research was invited.
A large number of scientists from other laboratories and
organizations, professors from academic institutions,
representatives of the armed forces, production centres,
and inspection authorities, who were our business partners
now, were present on this occasion. A closed-circuit TV
network had to be pressed into operation to ensure proper
communication between the participants for we had no
single place to accommodate all the invitees. This was the
second most significant day in my career, next only to 18
July 1980, when the SLV-3 had launched Rohini into the
earth’s orbit.

Stewards
T
he launch of the IGMDP was like a bright flash on the
Indian scientific firmament. Missile Technology had been
considered the domain of a few selected nations in the
world. People
were curious to see how, with what India had at that
point of time, we were going to achieve all that was
promised. The magnitude of the IGMDP was really
unprecedented in the country and the schedules projected
were quite quixotic by the norms and standards prevailing
in the Indian R&D establishments. I was fully aware that
obtaining sanction for the programme could at best be
seen as only ten per cent of the work done. To get it going
would be quite a different matter altogether. The more you
have, the more there is to maintain. Now that we had been
given all the necessary money and freedom to proceed, I
had to take my team forward and fulfill the promises I had
made.
What would be needed to realise this missile
programme, from the design to the deployment stages?
Excellent manpower was available; money had been
sanctioned; and some infrastructure also existed. What
was lacking then? What else does a project need to
succeed apart from these three vital inputs? From my SLV-
3 experience, I thought I knew the answer. The crux was
going to be out mastery over missile technology. I expected
nothing from abroad. Technology is a group activity and we
would need leaders who could not only put their heart and
soul into the missile programme, but also carry along with
them hundreds of other engineers and scientists. We knew
we had to be prepared to encounter numerous
contradictions and procedural absurdities that were
prevalent in the participating laboratories. We would have
to counteract the existing attitudes of our public sector
units, which believed that their performance would never be
tested. The whole system—its people, procedures,
infrastructure—would have to learn to extend itself. We
decided to achieve something that was way beyond our
collective national capability and I, for one, had no illusions
about the fact that unless our teams worked on the basis of
proportion or probability, nothing would be achieved.
The most remarkable thing about DRDL was its large
pool of highly talented people, many of whom were,
unfortunately, 
full 
of 
egotism 
and 
rebelliousness.
Unfortunately, they had not even accumulated enough
experience to make them confident about their own
judgement. On the whole, they would discuss matters very
enthusiastically, but would finally accept what a select few
said. They would unquestioningly believe in outside
specialists.
A particularly interesting person I met in DRDL was AV
Ranga Rao. He was very articulate and had an impressive
personality. His usual garb consisted of a red neck-tie with
a checked coat and loose trousers. He would wear this in
the hot climate of Hyderabad, where even a longsleeved
shirt 
and 
shoes 
are 
considered 
an 
avoidable
inconvenience. With his thick white beard and a pipe
clamped between his teeth, there was a certain aura
around this extremely gifted, but rather egocentric
individual.
I consulted Ranga Rao on revamping the existing
management system to achieve an optimum utilization of
human resources. Ranga Rao had a series of meetings
with the scientists sharing our vision of developing
indigenous missile technology and explaining the different
aspects of the IGMDP. After prolonged discussions, we
decided to reorganize the laboratory into a technology-
oriented structure. We needed to accommodate a matrix
type of structure for the execution of various activities
needed for the projects. In less than four months, four
hundred scientists began to work on the missile
programme.
During this period, the most important task before me
was the selection of the Project Directors to lead individual
missile projects. We had a very large pool of talent. In fact,
it was a market of plenty. The question was whom to pick—
a go-getter, a planner, a maverick, a dictator or a team
man? I had to get the right type of leader who could clearly
visualize the goal, and channelise the energies of his team
members who would be working at different work centres in
pursuit of their own individual goals.
It was a difficult game, some rules of which I had learnt
while working on ISRO’s high priority projects for two
decades. The wrong choice would jeopardise the entire
future of the programme. I had a detailed discussion with a
large number of prospective scientists and engineers. I
wanted these five Project Directors to train another twenty-
five project directors and team leaders of tomorrow.
Many of my senior colleagues—naming them would be
unfair, because it could be only my imagination—tried to
befriend me during this period. I respected their concern for
a lonely man, but avoided any close contacts. Through
loyalty to a friend one can be easily led into doing
something that is not in the best interests of the
organization.
Perhaps the main motive behind my isolation was my
desire to escape from the demands of relationships, which
I consider very difficult in comparison to making rockets. All
I desired was to be true to my way of life, to uphold the
science of rocketry in my country and to retire with a clean
conscience. I took quite some time and did a lot of hard
thinking to decide who should lead the five projects. I
examined the working styles of many scientists before
making my decision. I think some of my observations may
interest you.
A basic aspect of a person’s working style is how he
plans and organizes tasks. At one extreme is the cautious
planner, who carefully spells out each step before making
any move. With a sharp eye for what can possibly go
wrong, he tries to cover all contingencies. At the other end
is the fast mover, who weaves and dodges without a plan.
Inspired by an idea, the fast mover is always ready for
action.
Another aspect of a person’s working style is control—
the energy and attention devoted to ensuring that things
happen in a certain way. At one extreme is the tight
controller, a strict administrator with frequent checkpoints.
Rules and policies are to be followed with religious fervour.
At the opposite end are those who move with freedom and
flexibility. They have little patience for bureaucracy. They
delegate easily and give their subordinates wide latitude
for movement. I wanted leaders who tread the middle path,
those who could control without stifling dissent or being
rigid.
I wanted men who had the capability to grow with
possibilities, with the patience to explore all possible
alternatives, with the wisdom to apply old principles to new
situations; people with the skill to negotiate their way
forward. I wanted them to be accommodating, to be willing
to share their power with others and work in teams,
delegating good jobs, assimilating fresh opinions,
respecting intelligent people, and listening to wise counsel.
They would have to be able to sort out things amicably, and
take responsibility for slip-ups. Above all, they should be
able to take failure in their stride and share in both success
and failure.
My search for someone to lead the Prithvi project ended
with Col VJ Sundaram who belonged to the EME Corps of
the Indian Army. With a post-graduate degree in
Aeronautical Engineering and expertise in mechanical
vibrations, Sundaram was head of the Structures Group at
DRDL. I found in him a readiness to experiment with new
ways of resolving conflicting points of view. He was an
experimenter and innovator in team work. He had an
extraordinary capability for evaluating alternative ways of
operating. He would suggest moving forward into new
terrains that could lead to a solution which had not been
perceived earlier. Though a particular goal might be clear
to a project leader, and he may be capable of giving
adequate directions for accomplishing it, there can be
resistance from subordinates if the goal makes no sense to
them. Therein lies the importance of a leader who provides
effective work directions. I thought the Project Director of
Prithvi would be the first to make decisions with production
agencies and the armed forces, and Sundaram would be
the ideal choice to see that sound decisions were taken.
For Trishul, I was looking for a man who not only had a
sound knowledge of electronics and missile warfare, but
who could also communicate the complexities to his team
in order to promote understanding and to earn his team’s
support. I found in Cmde SR Mohan, who sailed into
Defence R&D from the Indian Navy, a talent for detail and
an almost magical power of persuasion.
For Agni, my dream project, I needed somebody who
would tolerate my occasional meddling in the running of this
project. In RN Agarwal I found the right person. He was an
alumnus of MIT with a brilliant academic record and had
been managing the Aeronautical Test Facilities at DRDL
with keen professional acumen.
Due to technological complexities, Akash and Nag
were then considered missiles of the future; their activities
were expected to peak about half a decade later.
Therefore, I selected the relatively young Prahlada and NR
Iyer for Akash and Nag. Two other young men, VK
Saraswat and AK Kapoor were made deputies to
Sundaram and Mohan respectively.
In those days, there was no forum in DRDL where
issues of general importance could be openly discussed
and decisions debated. Scientists, it must be remembered,
are basically emotional people. Once they stumble, it is
difficult for them to pull themselves together. Setbacks and
disappointments have always been and always will be an
inherent part of any career, even one in science. However, I
did not want any of my scientists to face disappointments
alone. I also wanted to ensure that none of them set their
goals when they were at a low ebb. To avoid such
eventualities a Science Council was created—a sort of
panchayat where the community would sit together and
take common decisions. Every three months, all scientists
—juniors and seniors, veterans and freshers— would sit
together and let off steam.
The very first meeting of the Council was eventful. After
a spell of half-hearted enquiries and expressions of doubt,
one senior scientist, MN Rao, shot a straight question: “On
what basis did you select these five Pandavas (he meant
the Project Directors)?” I was, in fact, expecting this
question. I wanted to tell him that I found all these five
Pandavas married to the Draupadi of positive thinking.
Instead, I told Rao to wait and see. I had chosen them to
take charge of a long-term programme where new storms
would arise everyday.
Every tomorrow, I told Rao, will give opportunities to
these enthusiastic people—the Agarwals, Prahladas, Iyers,
and Saras-wats— to gain a fresh perspective on their
goals and a strong hold on their commitments.
What makes a productive leader? In my opinion, a
productive leader must be very competent in staffing. He
should 
continually 
introduce 
new 
blood 
into 
the
organization. He must be adept at dealing with problems
and new concepts. The problems encountered by an R&D
organization typically involve trade-offs among a wide
variety of known and unknown parameters. Skill in handling
these complex entities is important in achieving high
productivity. The leader must be capable of instilling
enthusiasm in his team. He should give appropriate credit
where it is due; praise publicly, but criticize privately.
One of the most difficult questions came from a young
scientist: “How are you going to stop these projects from
going the Devil way?” I explained to him the philosophy
behind IGMDP—it begins with design and ends in
deployment. The participation of the production centres and
user agencies right from the design stage had been
ensured and there was no question of going back till the
missile systems had been successfully deployed in the
battlefield.
While the process of forming teams and organizing
work was going on, I found that the space available at
DRDL was grossly inadequate to meet the enhanced
requirements of IGMDP. Some of the facilities would have
to be located at a nearby site. The missile integration and
checkout facility built during the Devil phase consisted only
of a 120 sq. metre shed thickly populated with pigeons.
Where was the space and the facility to integrate the five
missiles 
which 
would 
arrive 
here 
shortly? 
The
Environmental Test Facility and the Avionics Laboratory
were equally cramped and ill-equipped. I visited the nearby
Imarat Kancha area. It used to be the test range for anti-
tank missiles developed by DRDL decades ago. The
terrain was barren—there were hardly any trees— and
dotted with large boulders typical of the Deccan plateau. I
felt as if there was some tremendous energy trapped in
these stones. I decided to locate the integration and check-
out facilities needed for the missile projects here. For the
next three years, this became my mission.
We drew up a proposal to establish a model high
technology research centre with very advanced technical
facilities like an inertial instrumentation laboratory, full-scale
environmental and electronic warfare (EMI/EMC) test
facilities, a composites production centre, high enthalpy
facility, and a state-of-the-art missile integration and
checkout centre. By any standards, this was a gigantic
task. An altogether different brand of expertise, grit and
determination were required to realise this project. Goals
and objectives had already been decided upon. Now they
had to be shared with a large number of people from
various agencies, through the problem-solving and
communication processes that the leader of the team must
build and maintain. Who would be the most suitable person
to do so? I saw almost all the required leadership qualities
in MV Suryakantha Rao. Then, as a large number of
agencies would participate in the creation of Research
Centre Imarat (RCI), someone had to protect hierarchical
sensitivities. I selected Krishna Mohan, who was in his
midthirties, to complement Suryakantha Rao, who was in
his late fifties at that time. Krishna Mohan would encourage
involvement rather than relying on obedience and
monitoring people at their workplaces.
According 
to 
the 
established 
procedure, 
we
approached the Military Engineering Services (MES) for
the RCI construction work. They said it would take five
years to complete the task. The matter was discussed in
depth at the highest level in the Ministry of Defence and a
landmark decision to entrust the responsibility of building
defence structures to an outside construction company was
taken. We liaised with the Survey of India and the National
Remote Sensing Agency for the inspection of the contour
maps and for obtaining aerial photographs of the Imarat
Kancha to prepare a layout for the approach roads and the
location of the facilities. The Central Ground Water Board
identified twenty locations amid the rocks to tap water.
Infrastructure to provide 40 MVA power and 5 million litres
of water per day was planned.
It was also at this time that Col SK Salwan, a
mechanical engineer with boundless energy, joined us. In
the final phase of construction, Salwan discovered an
ancient place of worship among the boulders. It seemed to
me that this place was blessed.
Now that we had started working on the design of the
missile systems and development had already commenced
for their integration and checkout, the next logical step was
to look for a suitable site for the missile flight trials. With
SHAR also in Andhra Pradesh, the search for a suitable
site spread towards the eastern coastline and finally ended
at Balasore in Orissa. A site along the north-eastern coast
was identified for a National Test Range. Unfortunately the
entire project ran into rough weather because of the
political issues raised around the evacuation of people
living in that area. We decided therefore to create an
interim infrastructure adjacent to the Proof Experimental
Establishment (PXE) at Chandipur in Balasore district of
Orissa. A funding of Rs 30 crores had been given to
construct the range, called the Interim Test Range (ITR). Dr
HS Rama Rao and his team did an excellent job of working
out innovative and cost-effective specifications for electro-
optical tracking instruments, a tracking telescope system
and an instrumentation tracking radar. Lt Gen RS Deswal
and Maj Gen KN Singh took charge of creating the launch
pad and range infrastructure. There was a beautiful bird
sanctuary in Chandipur. I asked the engineers to design the
test range without disturbing it.
Creating the RCI was perhaps the most satisfying
experience of my life. Developing this centre of excellence
of missile technology was akin to the joy of a potter shaping
artifacts of lasting beauty from the mundane clay.
Defence Minister R Venkataraman visited DRDL in
September 1983 to appraise himself of the activities of
IGMDP. He advised us to list all the resources we needed
to achieve our goals, overlooking nothing, and then include
in the list our own positive imagination and faith. “What you
imagine, is what will transpire. What you believe is what you
will achieve,” he said. Both Dr Arunachalam and I saw in
the horizon endless possibilities stretching out before
IGMDP; and our enthusiasm proved infectious. We were
excited and encouraged to see the best professionals in
the country gravitating towards IGMDP. Who would not
want to associate with a winner? The word had evidently
got around that the IGMDP was a born winner.

We were at a meeting laying down the targets for 1984,
when news came of Dr Brahm Prakash’s death on the
evening of 3 January at Bombay. It was a great emotional
loss for me, for I had had the privilege of working under him
during the most challenging period of my career. His
compassion and humility were exemplary. His healing
touch on the day of the failed SLV-E1 flight surfaced in my
memory serving to deepen my sorrow.
If Prof. Sarabhai was the creator of VSSC, Dr Brahm
Prakash was the executor. He had nurtured the institution
when it most needed nourishment. Dr Brahm Prakash
played a very important role in shaping my leadership skills.
In fact my association with him was a turning point in my
life. His humility mellowed me and helped me discard my
aggressive approach. His humility did not consist merely in
being modest about his talents or virtues, but in respecting
the dignity of all those who worked under him and in
recognizing the fact that no one is infallible, not even the
leader. He was an intellectual giant with a frail constitution;
he had a childlike innocence and I always considered him a
saint among scientists.
During this period of renaissance at DRDL, an altitude
control system and an on-board computer developed by P
Banerjee, KV Ramana Sai and their team was almost
ready. The success of this effort was very vital for any
indigenous missile development programme. All the same,
we had to have a missile to test this important system.
After many brainstorming sessions, we decided to
improvise a Devil missile to test the system. A Devil missile
was dis-assembled, many modifications made, extensive
subsystem testing was done and the missile checkout
system was reconfigured. After installing a make-shift
launcher, the modified and extended range Devil missile
was fired on 26 June 1984 to flight test the first indigenous
Strap-down Inertial Guidance system. The system met all
the requirements. This was the first and very significant
step in the history of Indian missile development, which had
so far been restricted to reverse engineering, towards
designing our own systems. A long-denied opportunity was
at last utilized by missile scientists at DRDL. The message
was loud and clear. We could do it!
It did not take long for the message to reach Delhi.
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi expressed her desire to
personally apprise herself of the progress of the IGMDP.
The entire organization was filled with an aura of
excitement. On 19 July 1984, Shrimati Gandhi visited
DRDL.
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was a person with a
tremendous sense of pride—in herself, in her work and in
her country. I deemed it an honour to receive her at DRDL
as she had instilled some of her own pride into my
otherwise modest frame of mind. She was immensely
conscious that she was the leader of eight hundred million
people. Every step, every gesture, every movement of her
hands was optimised. The esteem in which she held our
work in the field of guided missiles boosted our morale
immensely.
During the one hour that she spent at DRDL, she
covered wideranging aspects of the IGMDP, from flight
system plans to multiple development laboratories. In the
end, she addressed the 2000-strong DRDL community.
She asked for the schedules of the flight system that we
were working on. “When are you going to flight test Prithvi?”
Shrimati Gandhi asked. I said, “June 1987.” She
immediately responded, “Let me know what is needed to
accelerate the flight schedule.” She wanted scientific and
technological results fast. “Your fast pace of work is the
hope of the entire nation,” she said. She also told me that
the emphasis of the IGMDP should be not only on schedule
but also on the pursuance of excellence. “No matter what
you achieve, you should never be completely satisfied and
should always be searching for ways to prove yourself,” she
added. Within a month, she demonstrated her interest and
support by sending the newly appointed Defence Minister,
SB Chavan, to review our projects. Shrimati Gandhi’s
follow-up approach was not only impressive, it was
effective too. Today, everyone associated with aerospace
research in our country knows that excellence is
synonymous with the IGMDP.
We had our home-grown, but effective, management
techniques. One such technique was concerned with follow-
up of project activities. It basically consisted of analysing
the technical as well as procedural applicability of a
possible solution, testing it with the work centres,
discussing it with the general body of associates and
implementing it after enlisting everybody’s support. A large
number of original ideas sprung up from the grass root level
of participating work centres. If you were to ask me to
indicate the single most important managerial tactic in this
successful programme, I would point to the pro-active
follow-up. Through follow-up on the work done at different
laboratories on design, planning, supporting services, and
by the inspection agencies and academic institutions, rapid
progress has been achieved in the most harmonious
manner. In fact, the work code in the Guided Missile
Programme Office was: if you need to write a letter to a
work centre, send a fax; if you need to send a telex or fax,
telephone; and if the need arises for telephonic
discussions, visit the place personally.
The power of this approach came to light when Dr
Arunachalam conducted a comprehensive status review of
IGMDP on 27 September 1984. Experts from DRDO
Laboratories, ISRO, academic institutions, and production
agencies gathered to critically review the progress made
and problems faced in the first year of implementation.
Major decisions like the creation of facilities at Imarat
Kancha and the establishment of a test facility were
crystallized during the review. The future infrastructure at the
Imarat Kancha was given the name of Research Centre
Imarat (RCI), retaining the original identity of the place.
It was a pleasure to find an old acquaintance, TN
Seshan, on the review board. Between SLV-3 and now, we
had developed a mutual affection. However, this time as
the Defence Secretary, Seshan’s queries about the
schedules and viability of financial propositions presented
were much more pointed. Seshan is a person who enjoys
verbally bringing adversaries to their knees. Using his
sharp-edged humour, Seshan would make his opponents
look ridiculous. Although he is prone to be loud and can turn
argumentative on occasions, in the end he would always
ensure maximization of all available resources towards a
solution that was within implementation. At a personal level,
Seshan is a very kind-hearted and considerate person. My
team was particularly pleased to answer his questions
about the advanced technology employed in the IGMDP. I
still remember his uncanny curiosity about the indigenous
development of carbon-carbon composites. And to let you
into a small secret—Seshan is perhaps the only person in
the world who enjoys calling me by my full name which
contains 
31 
letters 
and 
five 
words—Avul 
Pakir
Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam.
The missile programme had been pursued concurrently
and had partners in design, development and production
from 12 academic institutions and 30 laboratories from
DRDO, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research
(CSIR), ISRO and industry. In fact, more than 50 professors
and 100 research scholars worked on missile-related
problems in the laboratories of their respective institutes.
The quality of work achieved through this partnership in that
one year had given me tremendous confidence that any
development task could be undertaken within the country so
long as we have our focussed schedules. Four months
before this review, I think it was during April–June 1984, six
of us in the missile programme visited academic
campuses and enlisted promising young graduates. We
presented an outline of the missile programme before the
professors and the aspiring students, about 350 of them,
and requested them to participate. I informed the reviewers
that we were expecting around 300 young engineers to join
our laboratories.
Roddam Narasimha, then Director of the National
Aeronautical Laboratory, used the occasion of this review
to put up a strong case for technology initiative. He cited
the experiences of the green revolution, which had
demonstrated beyond doubt that if the goals were clear,
there was enough talent available in the country to tackle
major technological challenges.
When India carried out its first nuclear explosion for
peaceful purposes, we declared ourselves the sixth country
in the world to explode a nuclear device. When we
launched SLV-3 we were the fifth country to achieve
satellite launch capability. When were we going to be the
first or second country in the world to achieve a
technological feat?
I listened carefully to the review members as they aired
their opinions and doubts, and I learned from their collective
wisdom. It was indeed a great education for me. Ironically,
all through school, we were taught to read, write and speak,
but never to listen, and the situation remains much the
same today. Traditionally, Indian scientists have been very
good speakers, but have inadequately developed listening
skills. We made a resolution to be attentive listeners. Are
engineering structures not built on the foundation of
functional utility? Does technical know-how not form its
bricks? And, are these bricks not put together with the
mortar of constructive criticism? The foundation had been
laid, the bricks baked, and now the mortar to cement our
act together was being mixed.
We were working on the action plan that had emerged
from the earlier month’s review, when the news of Shrimati
Gandhi’s assassination broke. This was followed by the
news of widespread violence and riots. A curfew had been
imposed in Hyderabad city. We rolled up the PERT charts
and a city map was spread out over the table to organize
transport and safe passage for all employees. In less than
an hour, the laboratory wore a deserted look. I was left
sitting alone in my office. The circumstances of Shrimati
Gandhi’s death were very ominous. The memories of her
visit barely three months ago further deepened my pain.
Why should great people meet with such horrific ends? I
recollected my father telling someone in a similar context:
“Good and bad people live together under the sun as the
black thread and the white are woven together in a cloth.
When either one of the black or white thread breaks, the
weaver shall look into the whole cloth, and he shall examine
the loom also.” When I drove out of the laboratory there was
not a single soul on the road. I kept thinking about the loom
of the broken thread.
Shrimati Gandhi’s death was a tremendous loss to the
scientific community. She had given impetus to scientific
research in the country. But India is a very resilient nation. It
gradually absorbed the shock of Shrimati Gandhi’s
assassination, although at the cost of thousands of lives
and a colossal loss of property. Her son, Rajiv Gandhi, took
over as the new Prime Minister of India. He went to the
polls and obtained a mandate from the people to carry
forward the policies of Mrs. Gandhi, the Integrated Guided
Missile Development Programme being a part of them.
By the summer of 1985, all the groundwork had been
completed for building the Missile Technology Research
Centre at Imarat Kancha. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi laid
the foundation stone of the Research Centre Imarat (RCI)
on 3 August 1985. He appeared very pleased with the
progress made. There was a child-like curiosity in him
which was very engaging. The grit and determination
displayed by his mother when she visited us a year ago
was also present in him, although with a small difference.
Madam Gandhi was a taskmaster, whereas Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi used his charisma to achieve his ends. He
told the DRDL family that he realised the hardships faced
by Indian scientists and expressed his gratitude towards
those who preferred to stay back and work in their
motherland rather than go abroad for comfortable careers.
He said that nobody could concentrate on work of this type
unless he was free from the trivialities of daily life, and
assured us that whatever necessary would be done to
make scientists’ lives more comfortable.
Within a week of his visit, I left for the USA with Dr
Arunachalam on an invitation from the United States Air
Force. Roddam Narasimha of National Aeronautical
Laboratory and KK Ganapathy of HAL accompanied us.
After finishing our work at the Pentagon in Washington, we
landed in San Francisco on our way to Los Angeles to visit
Northrop Corporation. I utilized this opportunity to visit the
Crystal Cathedral built by my favourite author, Robert
Schuller. I was amazed by the sheer beauty of this all-glass,
four-pointed, star-shaped structure that is more than 400
feet from one point to another. The glass roof which is 100
feet longer than a football field seemed to float in space.
This Cathedral has been built at the cost of several million
dollars through donations organized by Schuller. “God can
do tremendous things through the person who doesn’t care
about who gets the credit. The ego involvement must go,”
writes Schuller. “Before God trusts you with success, you
have to prove yourself humble enough to handle the big
prize.” I prayed to God in Schuller’s church to help me build
a Research Centre at the Imarat Kancha—that would be my
Crystal Cathedral.

Triumphant
The young engineers, 280 to be precise, changed the
dynamics of DRDL. It was a valuable experience for all of
us. We were now in a position to develop, through these
young teams, a re-entry technology and structure, a
millimetric wave radar, a phased array radar, rocket
systems and other such equipment. When we first assigned
these tasks to the young scientists, they did not fully grasp
the importance of their work. Once they did, they felt uneasy
under the burden of the tremendous faith placed in them. I
still remember one young man telling me, “There is no big
shot in our team, how will we be able to break through?” I
told him, “A big shot is a little shot who keeps on shooting,
so keep trying.” It was astonishing to see how in the young
scientific environment, negative attitudes changed to
positive and things that were previously thought impractical
began happening. Many older scientists were rejuvenated
simply by being part of a young team.
It has been my personal experience that the true flavour,
the real fun, the continuous excitement of work lie in the
process of doing it rather than in having it over and done
with. To return to the four basic factors that I am convinced
are involved in successful outcomes: goal-setting, positive
thinking, visualizing, and believing.
By now, we had gone through an elaborate exercise of
goal-setting and enthused the young scientists about these
goals. At the review meetings, I would insist that the
youngest scientists present their team’s work. That would
help them in visualizing the whole system. Gradually, an
atmosphere of confidence grew. Young scientists started
questioning senior colleagues on solid technical issues.
Nothing daunted them, because they feared nothing. If there
were doubts, they rose above them. They soon became
persons of power. A person with belief never grovels
before anyone, whining and whimpering that it’s all too
much, that he lacks support, that he is being treated
unfairly. Instead, such a person tackles problems head on
and then affirms, ‘As a child of God, I am greater than
anything that can happen to me’. I tried to keep the work
environment lively with a good blend of the experience of
the older scientists mixed with the skills of their younger
colleagues. This positive dependence between youth and
experience had created a very productive work culture at
DRDL.
The first launch of the Missile Programme was
conducted on 16 September 1985, when Trishul took off
from the test range at Sriharikota (SHAR). It was a ballistic
flight meant for testing the inflight performance of the solid
propellant rocket motor. Two C-Band radars and Kalidieo-
theodolite (KTLs) were used to track the missile from the
ground. The test was successful. The launcher, rocket
motor and telemetry systems functioned as planned. The
aerodynamic drag however was higher than the estimates
predicted on the basis of wind tunnel testing. In terms of
technology breakthrough or experience enrichment, this
test was of little value but the real achievement of this test
was to remind my DRDL friends that they could fly missiles
without being driven by the brute demands of compliance
or reverse engineering. In a swift stroke, the psyche of the
DRDL 
scientists 
experienced 
a 
multi-dimensional
expansion.
This was followed by the successful test flight of the
Pilotless Target Aircraft (PTA). Our engineers had
developed the rocket motor for the PTA designed by the
Bangalore-based 
Aeronautical 
Development
Establishment (ADE). The motor had been type- approved
by DTD&P (Air). This was a small but significant step
towards developing missile hardware that is not only
functional but also acceptable to the user agencies. A
private sector firm was engaged to produce a reliable,
airworthy, high thrust-to-weight ratio rocket motor with
technology input from DRDL. We were slowly graduating
from single laboratory projects to multi-laboratory
programmes 
to 
laboratory-industry 
exercises. 
The
development of PTA symbolized a great confluence of four
different organizations. I felt as if I was standing at a
meeting point and looking at the roads coming from ADE,
DTD&P (Air) and ISRO. The fourth road was the DRDL, a
highway to national self-reliance in missile technology.
Taking our partnership with the academic institutions of
the country a step further, Joint Advanced Technology
Programmes were started at the Indian Institute of Science
(IISc), and Jadavpur University. I have always had a deep
regard for academic institutions and reverence for excellent
academicians. I value the inputs that academicians can
make to development. Formal requests had been placed
with these institutions and arrangements arrived at under
which expertise from their faculties would be extended to
DRDL in pursuance of its projects.
Let me highlight a few contributions of academic
institutions to the various missile systems. Prithvi had been
designed as an inertially guided missile. To reach the
target accurately, the trajectory parameters have to be
loaded into its brain—an on-board computer. A team of
young engineering graduates at Jadavpur University under
the guidance of Prof. Ghoshal developed the required
robust guidance algorithm. At the IISc, postgraduate
students under the leadership of Prof. IG Sharma
developed air defence software for multi-target acquisition
by Akash. The re- entry vehicle system design methodology
for Agni was developed by a young team at IIT Madras and
DRDO scientists. Osmania University’s Navigational
Electronics Research and Training Unit had developed
stateof-the-art signal processing algorithms for Nag. I have
only given a few examples of collaborative endeavour. In
fact, it would have been very difficult to achieve our
advanced 
technological 
goals 
without 
the 
active
partnership of our academic institutions.
Let us consider the example of the Agni payload
breakthrough. Agni is a two-stage rocket system and
employs re-entry technology developed in the country for
the first time. It is boosted by a first-stage solid rocket
motor derived from SLV-3 and further accelerated at the
second stage with the liquid rocket engines of Prithvi. For
the Agni, the payload gets delivered at hypersonic speeds,
which calls for the design and development of a re-entry
vehicle structure. The payload with guidance electronics is
housed in the re-entry vehicle structure, which is meant to
protect the payload by keeping the inside temperature
within the limit of 40oC, when the outside skin temperature
is greater than 2500oC. An inertial guidance system with
an on-board computer guides the payload to the required
target. For any re-entry missile system, three-dimensional
preforms are core material for making the carbon-carbon
nose tip that will remain strong even at such high
temperatures. Four laboratories of DRDO and the CSIR
achieved this in a short span of 18 months— something
other countries could do only after a decade of research
and development!
Another challenge involved in the Agni payload design
was related to the tremendous speed with which it would
re-enter the atmosphere. In fact, Agni would re-enter the
atmosphere at twelve times the speed of sound (12 Mach,
as we call it in science). At this tremendous speed, we had
no experience of how to keep the vehicle under control. To
carry out a test, we had no wind tunnel to generate that kind
of speed. If we sought American help, we would have been
seen as aspiring to something they considered their
exclusive privilege. Even if they consented to co-operate,
they would be certain to quote a price for their wind tunnel
greater than our entire project budget. Now, the question
was how to beat the system. Prof. SM Deshpande of the
IISc found four young, bright scientists working in the field of
fluid dynamics and, within six months, developed the
software for Computational Fluid Dynamics for Hypersonic
Regimes, which is one of its kind in the world.
Another achievement was the development of a missile
trajectory simulation software, ANUKALPANA by Prof. IG
Sharma of IISc to evaluate multi-target acquisition
capabilities of an Akash-type weapon system. No country
would have given us this kind of software, but we
developed it indigenously.
In yet another example of creating a synergy of scientific
talent, Prof. Bharati Bhatt of IIT Delhi, working with the Solid
Physics Laboratory (SPL) and Central Electronics Limited
(CEL), broke the monopoly of the western countries by
developing ferrite phase shifters for use in the multi-
function, multi-tasking 3-D Phased Army Radar for
surveillence, tracking and guidance of Akash. Prof. Saraf of
IIT, Kharagpur, working with BK Mukho-padhyay, my
colleague at RCI, made a millimetric wave (MMW) antenna
for the Nag Seeker Head in two years, a record even by
international standards. The Central Electrical and
Electronics Research Institute (CEERI), Pilani developed
an Impatt Diode in consortium with the SPL and RCI to
overcome technological foreign dependence in creating
these components, which are the heart of any MMW
device.
As work on the project spread horizontally, performance
appraisal became more and more difficult. DRDO has an
assessment-linked policy. Leading nearly 500 scientists, I
had to finalize their performance appraisals in the form of
Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs). These reports would
be forwarded to an assessment board comprised of
outside specialists for recommendations. Many people
viewed this part of my job uncharitably. Missing a
promotion was conveniently translated as a dislike I had
towards them. Promotions of other colleagues were seen
as subjective favours granted by me. Entrusted with the
task of performance evaluation, I had to be a fair judge.
To truly understand a judge, you must understand the
riddle of the scales; one side heaped high with hope, the
other side holding apprehension. When the scales dip,
bright optimism turns into silent panic.
When a person looks at himself, he is likely to misjudge
what he finds. He sees only his intentions. Most people
have good intentions and hence conclude that whatever
they are doing is good. It is difficult for an individual to
objectively judge his actions, which may be, and often are,
contradictory to his good intentions. Most people come to
work with the intention of doing it. Many of them do their
work in a manner they find convenient and leave for home
in the evening with a sense of satisfaction. They do not
evaluate their performance, only their intentions. It is
assumed that because an individual has worked with the
intention of finishing his work in time, if delays occurred,
they were due to reasons beyond his control. He had no
intention of causing the delay. But if his action or inaction
caused that delay, was it not intentional?
Looking back on my days as a young scientist, I am
aware that one of the most constant and powerful urges I
experienced was my desire to be more than what I was at
that moment. I desired to feel more, learn more, express
more. I desired to grow, improve, purify, expand. I never
used any outside influence to advance my career. All I had
was the inner urge to seek more within myself. The key to
my motivation has always been to look at how far I had still
to go rather than how far I had come. After all, what is life
but a mixture of unsolved problems, ambiguous victories,
and amorphous defeats?
The trouble is that we often merely analyse life instead
of dealing with it. People dissect their failures for causes
and effects, but seldom deal with them and gain experience
to master them and thereby avoid their recurrence. This is
my belief: that through difficulties and problems God gives
us the opportunity to grow. So when your hopes and
dreams and goals are dashed, search among the
wreckage, you may find a golden opportunity hidden in the
ruins.
To motivate people to enhance their performance and
deal with depression is always a challenge for a leader. I
have observed an analogy between a force field
equilibrium and resistance to change in organizations. Let
us imagine change to be a coiled spring in a field of
opposing forces, such that some forces support change
and others resist it. By increasing the supportive forces
such as supervisory pressure, prospects of career growth
and monetary benefits or decreasing the resisting forces
such as group norms, social rewards, and work avoidance,
the situation can be directed towards the desired result—
but for a short time only, and that too only to a certain
extent. After a while the resisting forces push back with
greater force as they are compressed even more tightly.
Therefore, a better approach would be to decrease the
resisting force in such a manner that there is no
concomittant increase in the supporting forces. In this way,
less energy will be needed to bring about and maintain
change.
The result of the forces I mentioned above, is motive. It
is a force which is internal to the individual and forms the
basis of his behaviour in the work environment. In my
experience, most people possess a strong inner drive for
growth, competence, and self- actualization. The problem,
however, has been the lack of a work environment that
stimulates and permits them to give full expression to this
drive. Leaders can create a high productivity level by
providing the appropriate organizational structure and job
design, and by acknowledging and appreciating hard work.
I first attempted to build up such a supportive
environment in 1983, while launching IGMDP. The projects
were in the design phase at that time. The re-organization
resulted in at least forty per cent to fifty per cent increase in
the level of activity. Now that the multiple projects were
entering into the development and flight-testing stage, the
major and minor milestones reached gave the programme
visibility and continuous commitment. With the absorption
of a young team of scientists, the average age had been
brought down from 42 to 33 years. I felt it was time for a
second re-organization. But how should I go about it? I took
stock of the motivational inventory available at that time—
let me explain to you what I mean by this term. The
motivational inventory of a leader is made up of three types
of understanding: an understanding of the needs that
people expect to satisfy in their jobs, an understanding of
the effect that job design has on motivation, and an
understanding of the power of positive reinforcement in
influencing people’s behaviour.
The 1983 re-organization was done with the objective of
renewal: it was indeed a very complex exercise handled
deftly by AV Ranga Rao and Col R Swaminathan. We
created a team of newly-joined young scientists with just
one experienced person and gave them the challenge of
building the strap-down inertial guidance system, an on-
board computer and a ram rocket in propulsion system.
These exercises were being attempted for the first time in
the country, and the technology involved was comparable
with world-class systems. The guidance technology is
centred around the gyro and accelerometer package, and
electronics, to process the sensor output. The on-board
computer carries the mission computations and flight
sequencing. A ram rocket system breathes air to sustain its
high velocity for long durations after it is put through a
booster rocket. The young teams not only designed these
systems but also developed them into operational
equipment. Later Prithvi and then Agni used similar
guidance systems, with excellent results. The effort of these
young teams made the country self-reliant in the area of
protected technologies. It was a good demonstration of the
‘renewal factor’. Our intellectual capacity was renewed
through contact with enthusiastic young minds and had
achieved these outstanding results.
Now, besides the renewal of manpower, emphasis had
to be laid on augmenting the strength of project groups.
Often people seek to satisfy their social, egoistic, and self-
actualization needs at their workplaces. A good leader
must identify two different sets of environmental features.
One, which satisfies a person’s needs and the other, which
creates dissatisfaction with his work. We have already
observed that people look for those characteristics in their
work that relate to the values and goals which they consider
important as giving meaning to their lives. If a job meets the
employees’need 
for 
achievement, 
recognition,
responsibility, growth and advancement, they will work hard
to achieve goals.
Once the work is satisfying, a person then looks at the
environment and circumstances in the workplace. He
observes the policies of the administration, qualities of his
leader, security, status and working conditions. Then, he
correlates these factors to the inter-personal relations he
has with his peers and examines his personal life in the
light of these factors. It is the agglomerate of all these
aspects that decides the degree and quality of a person’s
effort and performance.
The matrix organization evolved in 1983 proved
excellent in meeting all these requirements. So, while
retaining this structure of the laboratory, we undertook a
task-design exercise. The scientists working in technology
directorates were made system managers to interact
exclusively with one project. An external fabrication wing
was formed under PK Biswas, a developmental fabrication
technologist of long standing, to deal with the public sector
undertakings (PSUs) and private sector firms associated
with the development of the missile hardware. This reduced
pressure on the in-house fabrication facilities and enabled
them to concentrate on jobs which could not be undertaken
outside, which in fact occupied all the three shifts.
Work on Prithvi was nearing completion when we
entered 1988. For the first time in the country, clustered
Liquid Propellant (LP) rocket engines with programmable
total impulse were going to be used in a missile system to
attain flexibility in payload range combination. Now,
besides the scope and quality of the policy decisions
Sundaram and I were providing to the Prithvi team, the
project’s success depended on creative ideas being
converted into workable products and the quality and
thoroughness of the team members’ contribution. Saraswat
with Y Gyaneshwar and P Venugopalan did a
commendable job in this regard. They instilled in their team
a sense of pride and achievement. The importance of
these rocket engines was not restricted to the Prithvi
project—it was a national achievement. Under their
collective leadership, a large number of engineers and
technicians understood and committed themselves to the
team goals, as well as the specific goals which each one of
them was committed to accomplish personally. Their entire
team worked under a self-evident sort of direction. Working
together with the Ordnance Factory, Kirkee, they also
completely eliminated the import content in the propellant
for these engines.
Leaving the vehicle development in the safe and
efficient hands of Sundaram and Saraswat, I started
looking at the mission’s vulnerable areas. Meticulous
planning had gone into the development of the launch
release mechanism (LRM) for the smooth lift-off of the
missile. The joint development of explosive bolts to hold the
LRM prior to the launch by DRDL and Explosive Research
and Development Laboratory (ERDL) was an excellent
example of multi- work centre coordination.
While flying, drifting into spells of contemplation and
looking down at the landscape below has always been my
favourite preoccupation. It is so beautiful, so harmonious,
so peaceful from a distance that I wonder where all those
boundaries are which separate district from district, state
from state, and country from country. Maybe such a sense
of distance and detachment is required in dealing with all
the activities of our life.
Since the Interim Test Range at Balasore was still at
least a year away from completion, we had set up special
facilities at SHAR for the launch of Prithvi. These included a
launch pad, block house, control consoles and mobile
telemetry stations. I had a happy reunion with my old friend
MR Kurup who was the Director, SHAR Centre by then.
Working with Kurup on the Prithvi launch campaign gave
me great satisfaction. Kurup worked for Prithvi as a team
member, ignoring the boundary lines that divide DRDO and
ISRO, DRDL and SHAR. Kurup used to spend a lot of time
with us at the launch pad. He complemented us with his
experience in range testing and range safety and worked
with great enthusiasm in propellant filling, making the
maiden Prithvi launch campaign a memorable experience.
Prithvi was launched at 11:23 hrs on 25 February 1988.
It was an epoch-making event in the history of rocketry in
the country. Prithvi was not merely a surface-to-surface
missile with a capability of delivering a 1000 kg
conventional warhead to a distance of 150 km with an
accuracy of 50 meter CEP; it was in fact the basic module
for all future guided missiles in the country. It already had
the provision for modification from a long-range surface to
an air missile system, and could also be deployed on a
ship.
The accuracy of a missile is expressed in terms of its
Circular Error Probable (CEP). This measures the radius of
a circle within which 50 per cent of the missiles fired will
impact. In other words, if a missile has a CEP of 1 km
(such as the Iraqi Scud missiles fired in the Gulf War), this
means that half of them should impact within 1 km of their
target. A missile with a conventional high-explosive
warhead and a CEP of 1 km would not normally be
expected to destroy or disable fixed military targets such as
a Command and Control Facility or an Air Base. It would
however be effective against an undefined target such as a
city.
The German V-2 missiles fired at London between
September 1944 and March 1945 had a conventional high-
explosive warhead and a very large CEP of some 17 km.
Yet the 500 V-2s which hit London succeeded in causing
more than 21,000 casualties and destroying about 200,000
homes.
When the West were crying themselves hoarse over the
NPT, we stressed upon building competence in core
guidance and control technologies to achieve a CEP as
precise as 50 m. With the success of the Prithvi trials, the
cold reality of a possible strategic strike even without a
nuclear warhead had silenced the critics to whispers about
a possible technology-conspiracy theory.
The launch of Prithvi sent shock waves across the
unfriendly neighbouring countries. The response of the
Western bloc was initially one of shock and then of anger. A
seven-nation technology embargo was clamped, making it
impossible for India to buy anything even remotely
connected with the development of guided missiles. The
emergence of India as a self-reliant country in the field of
guided missiles upset all the developed nations of the
world.

Torchbearers
Indian core competence in rocketry has been firmly
established again, beyond any doubt. The robust civilian
space industry and viable missilebased defences has
brought India into the select club of nations that call
themselves superpowers. Always encouraged to follow
Buddha’s or Gandhi’s teachings, how and why did India
become a missile power is a question that needs to be
answered for future generations.
Two centuries of subjugation, oppression and denial
have failed to kill the creativity and capability of the Indian
people. Within just a decade of gaining independence and
achieving sovereignty, Indian Space and Atomic Energy
Programmes were launched with a perfect orientation
towards peaceful applications. There were neither funds for
investing in missile development nor any established
requirement from the Armed Forces. The bitter
experiences of 1962 forced us to take the basic first steps
towards missile development.
Would a Prithvi suffice? Would the indigenous
development of four or five missile systems make us
sufficiently strong? Or would having nuclear weapons make
us stronger? Missiles and atomic weapons are merely
parts of a greater whole. As I saw it, the development of
Prithvi represented the self-reliance of our country in the
field of advanced technology. High technology is
synonymous with huge amounts of money and massive
infrastructure. Neither of these was available, unfortunately,
in adequate measure. So what could we do? Perhaps the
Agni 
missile 
being 
developed 
as 
a 
technology
demonstrator project, pooling all the resources available in
the country, could provide an answer?
I was very sure, even when we discussed REX in ISRO
about a decade ago, that Indian scientists and
technologists working together had the capability to
achieve this technological breakthrough. India can most
certainly achieve state-of-the-art technology through a
combined effort of the scientific laboratories and the
academic institutions. If one can liberate Indian industry
from the self-created image of being mere fabricating
factories, they can implement indigenously developed
technology and attain excellent results. To do this, we
adopted 
a 
threefold 
strategy— 
multi-institutional
participation, 
the 
consortium 
approach, 
and 
the
empowering technology. These were the stones rubbed
together to create Agni.
The Agni team was comprised of more than 500
scientists. Many organizations were networked to
undertake this huge effort of launching Agni. The Agni
mission had two basic orientations— work and workers.
Each member was dependent on the others in his team to
accomplish his target. Contradiction and confusion are the
two things most likely to occur in such situations. Different
leaders accommodate concern for workers while getting
work done, in their own personal ways. Some shed all
concern for workers in order to get results. They use people
merely as instruments to reach goals. Some give less
importance to the work, and make an effort to gain the
warmth and approval of people working with them. But what
this team achieved was the highest possible integration in
terms of both the quality of work and human relationships.
Involvement, participation and commitment were the key
words to functioning. Each of the team members appeared
to be performing by choice. The launching of Agni was the
common stake not only for our scientists, but for their
families too. VR Nagaraj was the leader of the electrical
integration team. Dedicated technologist that he is,
Nagaraj would forget basic requirements like food and
sleep while on the integration gig. His brother-in-law
passed away while he was at ITR. His family kept this
information from Nagaraj so that there would be no
interruption in his work towards the launching of Agni.
The Agni launch had been scheduled for 20 April 1989.
This was going to be an unprecedented exercise. Unlike
space launch vehicles, a missile launch involves wide-
ranging safety hazards. Two radars, three telemetry
stations, one telecommand station and four electro-optical
tracking instruments to monitor the missile trajectory had
been deployed. In addition, the telemetry station at Car
Nicobar (ISTRAC) and the SHAR radars were also
commissioned to track the vehicle. Dynamic surveillance
was employed to cover the electrical power that flows from
the missile batteries within the vehicle and to control
system pressures. Should any deviation be noticed either
in voltage or in pressure, the specially designed automatic
checkout system would signal “Hold”. The flight operations
would then be sequenced only if the defect was rectified.
The countdown for the launch started at T-36 hours. The
countdown from T-7.5 minutes was to be computer
controlled.
All activities preparatory to the launch went according to
schedule. We had decided to move the people living in
nearby villages to safety at the time of the launch. This
attracted media attention, and led to much controversy. By
the time 20 April 1989 arrived, the whole nation was
watching us. Foreign pressure was exerted through
diplomatic channels to abort the flight trial, but the Indian
Government stood behind us like a rock and staved off any
distraction to our work. We were at T-14 seconds when the
computer signalled “Hold”, indicating that one of the
instruments 
was 
functioning 
erratically. 
This 
was
immediately rectified. Meanwhile, the down-range station
asked for a “Hold”. In another few seconds, multiple Holds
were necessitated, resulting in irreversible internal power
consumption. We had to abort the launch. The missile had
to be opened up to replace the on-board power supplies. A
weeping Nagaraj, by now informed about the tragedy in his
family, met me and promised that he would be back within
three days. The profiles of these courageous people will
never be written about in any history book, but it is such
silent people on whose hard work generations thrive and
nations progress. Sending Nagaraj off, I met my team
members who were in a state of shock and sorrow. I
shared my SLV-3 experience with them. “I lost my launch
vehicle in the sea but recovered successfully. Your missile
is in front of you. In fact you have lost nothing but a few
weeks of rework.” This shook them out of their immobility
and the entire team went back to retrieve the subsystems
and re-charge them.
The press was up in arms, and fielded various
interpretations of the postponement of the flight to suit the
fancies of their readership. Cartoonist Sudhir Dar sketched
a shopkeeper returning a product to the salesman saying
that like Agni it would not take off. Another cartoonist
showed one Agni scientist explaining that the launch was
postponed because the press button did not make contact.
The Hindustan Times showed a leader consoling press
reporters, “There’s no need for any alarm ... it’s a purely
peaceful, non-violent missile”.
After a detailed analysis conducted virtually around the
clock for the next ten days, our scientists had the missile
ready for launch on 1 May 1989. But, again, during the
automatic computer checkout period at T10 seconds, a
Hold signal was indicated. A closer inspection showed that
one of the control components, S1-TVC was not working
according to the mission requirements. The launch had to
be postponed yet again. Now, such things are very
common in rocketry and quite often happen in other
countries too. But the expectant nation was in no mood to
appreciate our difficulties. The Hindu carried a cartoon by
Keshav showing a villager counting some currency notes
and commenting to another, “Yes, it’s the compensation for
moving away from my hut near the test site—a few more
postponements and I can build a house of my own...”.
Another cartoonist designated Agni as “ IDBM—
Intermittently Delayed Ballistic Missile.” Amul’s cartoon
suggested that what Agni needed to do was use their butter
as fuel!
I took some time off, leaving my team at ITR to talk to
the DRDLRCI community. The entire DRDL-RCI community
assembled after working hours on 8 May 1989. I
addressed the gathering of more than 2,000 persons, “Very
rarely is a laboratory or an R&D establishment given an
opportunity to be the first in the country to develop a system
such as Agni. A great opportunity has been given to us.
Naturally major opportunities are accompanied by equally
major challenges. We should not give up and we should not
allow the problem to defeat us. The country doesn’t deserve
anything less than success from us. Let us aim for
success”. I had almost completed my address, when I found
myself telling my people, “I promise you, we will be back
after successfully launching Agni before the end of this
month.”
Detailed analysis of the component failure during the
second attempt led to the refurbishment of the control
system. This task was entrusted to a DRDO-ISRO team.
The team carried out the rectification of the first stage
control system at the Liquid Propellant System Complex
(LPSC) of ISRO and completed the task in record time with
tremendous concentration and will-power. It was nothing
short of amazing how hundreds of scientists and staff
worked continuously and completed the system readiness
with acceptance tests in just 10 days. The aircraft took off
from Trivandrum with the rectified control systems and
landed close to ITR on the eleventh day. But now it was the
turn of hostile weather conditions to impede us. A cyclone
threat was looming large. All the work centres were
connected through satellite communication and HF links.
Meteorological data started flowing in at ten-minute
intervals.
Finally, the launch was scheduled for 22 May 1989. The
previous night, Dr Arunachalam, Gen KN Singh and I were
walking together with the Defence Minister KC Pant, who
had come to ITR to witness the launch. It was a full-moon
night, it was high tide and the waves crashed and roared,
as if singing of His glory and power. Would we succeed
with the Agni launch tomorrow? This question was foremost
in all our minds, but none of us was willing to break the spell
cast by the beautiful moonlit night. Breaking a long silence,
the Defence Minister finally asked me, “Kalam! what would
you like me to do to celebrate the Agni success tomorrow?”
It was a simple question, to which I could not think of an
answer immediately. What did I want? What was it that I did
not have? What could make me happier? And then I found
the answer. “We need 100,000 saplings to plant at RCI,” I
said. His face lit up with a friendly glow. “You are buying the
blessings of Mother Earth for Agni,” Defence Minister KC
Pant quipped. “We will succeed tomorrow”, he predicted.
The next day Agni took off at 0710 hrs. It was a perfect
launch. The missile followed a textbook trajectory. All flight
parameters were met. It was like waking up to a beautiful
morning from a nightmarish sleep. We had reached the
launch pad after five years of continuous work at multiple
work centres. We had lived through the ordeal of a series of
snags in the last five weeks. We had survived pressure
from everywhere to stop the whole thing. But we did it at
last! It was one of the greatest moments of my life. A mere
600 seconds of elegant flight washed off our entire fatigue
in an instant. What a wonderful culmination of our years of
labour. I wrote in my diary that night:
Do not look at Agni
as an entity directed upward
to deter the ominous
or exhibit your might.
It is fire
in the heart of an Indian.
Do not even give it
the form of a missile
as it clings to the
burning pride of this nation
and thus is bright.
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi called the Agni launch “a
major achievement in our continuing efforts to safeguard
our independence and security by self-reliant means. The
technology demonstration through Agni is a reflection of our
commitment to the indigenous development of advanced
technologies for the nation’s defence.” “The country is
proud of your efforts,” he told me. President Venkataraman
saw in the Agni success the fulfilment of his dream. He
cabled from Simla, “It is a tribute to your dedication, hard
work, and talent.”
A great deal of misinformation and disinformation had
been spread by vested interests about this technology
mission. Agni had never been intended only as a nuclear
weapon system. What it did was to afford us the option of
developing the ability to deliver non-nuclear weapons with
high precision at long ranges. That it provided us with a
viable nonnuclear option was of the greatest relevance to
contemporary strategic doctrines.
Great ire was raised by the test firing of Agni, according
to a wellknown American defence journal, especially in the
United States where Congressmen threatened to put a
stop to all dual-use and missile-related technologies, along
with all multinational aid.
Gary Milhollin, a so-called specialist in missiles and
warhead technologies, had made a claim in The Wall
Street Journal that India had made Agni with the help of
West Germany. I had a hearty laugh reading that the
German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR) had
developed Agni’s guidance system, the first-stage rocket,
and a composite nose cone, and that the aerodynamic
model of Agni was tested in the DLR wind tunnel. An
immediate denial came from the DLR, who in turn
speculated that France had supplied the Agni guidance
electronics. American Senator Jeff Bingaman even went to
the extent of suggesting that I picked up everything needed
for Agni during my four-month stay at Wallop’s Island in
1962. The fact that I was in Wallop’s Island more than 25
years ago and at that time the technology used in Agni did
not exist even in the United States was not mentioned.
In today’s world, technological backwardness leads to
subjugation. Can we allow our freedom to be compromised
on this account? It is our bounden duty to guarantee the
security and integrity of our nation against this threat.
Should we not uphold the mandate bequeathed to us by our
forefathers who fought for the liberation of our country from
imperialism? Only when we are technologically self-reliant
will we able to fulfill their dream.
Till the Agni launch, the Indian Armed Forces had been
structured for a strictly defensive role to safeguard our
nation, to shield our democratic processes from the
turbulence in the countries around us and to raise the cost
of any external intervention to an unacceptable level for
countries which may entertain such notions. With Agni,
India had reached the stage where she had the option of
preventing wars involving her.
Agni marked the completion of five years of IGMDP.
Now that it had demonstrated our competence in the crucial
area of re-entry technology and with tactical missiles like
Prithvi and Trishul already testfired, the launches of Nag
and Akash would take us into areas of competence where
there is little or no international competition. These two
missile systems contained within themselves the stuff of
major technological breakthroughs. There was a need to
focus our efforts more intensively on them.
In September 1989, I was invited by the Maharashtra
Academy of Sciences in Bombay to deliver the Jawaharlal
Nehru Memorial Lecture. I used this opportunity to share
with the budding scientists my plans of making an
indigenous Air-to-Air missile, Astra. It would dovetail with
the development of the Indian Light Combat Aircraft (LCA).
I told them that our work in Imaging Infra Red (IIR) and
Millimetric Wave (MMW) radar technology for the Nag
missile system had placed us in the vanguard of
international R&D efforts in missile technology. I also drew
their attention to the crucial role that carbon-carbon and
other advanced composite materials play in mastering the
re-entry technology. Agni was the conclusion of a
technological effort that was given its start by Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi when the country decided to break
free from the paralysing fetters of technological
backwardness and slough off the dead skin of
subordination to industrialized nations.
The second flight of Prithvi at the end of September
1988 was again a great success. Prithvi has proved to be
the best surface-to-surface missile in the world today. It can
carry 1000 kg of warhead to a distance of 250 km and
deliver it within a radius of 50 metres. Through computer
controlled operations, numerous warhead weight and
delivery distance combinations can be achieved in a very
short time and in battlefield conditions. It is a hundred per
cent indigenous in all respects—design, operations,
deployment. It can be produced in large numbers as the
production facilities at BDL were concurrently developed
during the development phase itself. The Army was quick to
recognize the potential of this commendable effort and
approached the CCPA for placing orders for Prithvi and
Trishul missile systems, something that had never
happened before.

Emancipators
O
n Republic Day 1990, the nation celebrated the success
of its missile programme. I was conferred the Padma
Vibhushan along with Dr Arunachalam. Two of my other
colleagues—
JC Bhattacharya and RN Agarwal—were also
decorated with the Padma Shree awards. It was the first
time in the history of free India that so many scientists
affiliated to the same organization found their names on the
awards list. Memories of the Padma Bhushan awarded a
decade ago came alive. I still lived more or less as I had
lived then—in a room ten feet wide and twelve feet long,
furnished mainly with books, papers and a few pieces of
hired furniture. The only difference was at that time, my
room was in Trivandrum and now it was in Hyderabad. The
mess bearer brought me my breakfast of idlis and
buttermilk and smiled in silent congratulation for the award.
I was touched by the recognition bestowed on me by my
countrymen. A large number of scientists and engineers
leave this country at their first opportunity to earn more
money abroad. It is true that they definitely get greater
monetary benefits, but could anything compensate for this
love and respect from one’s own countrymen?
I sat alone for a while in silent contemplation. The sand and
shells of
Rameswaram, the care of Iyadurai Solomon in
Ramanathapuram, the guidance of Rev. Father Sequeira in
Trichi and Prof. Pandalai in Madras, the encouragement of
Dr Mediratta in Bangalore, the hovercraft ride with Prof.
Menon, the pre-dawn visit to the Tilpat Range with Prof.
Sarabhai, the healing touch of Dr Brahm Prakash on the
day of the SLV3 failure, the national jubilation on the SLV-3
launch, Madam Gandhi’s appreciative smile, the post-SLV-
3 simmering at VSSC, Dr Ramanna’s faith in inviting me to
DRDO, the IGMDP, the creation of RCI, Prithvi, Agni...a
flood of memories swept over me. Where were all these
men now? My father, Prof. Sarabhai, Dr Brahm Prakash? I
wished I could meet them and share my joy with them. I felt
the paternal forces of heaven and the maternal and cosmic
forces of nature embrace me as parents would hug their
long-lost child. I scribbled in my diary:
Away! fond thoughts, and vex my soul no more!
Work claimed my wakeful nights, my busy days
Albeit brought memories of Rameswaram shore
Yet haunt my dreaming gaze!
A fortnight later, Iyer and his team celebrated the
awards for the missile programme with the maiden flight of
Nag. They repeated the feat again on the very next day,
thus testing twice over the first Indian all-composite
airframe and the propulsion system. These tests also
proved the worth of the indigenous thermal batteries.
India had achieved the status of having a third
generation anti-tank missile system with ‘fire-and-forget’
capability—on par with any stateof-the-art technology in the
world. Indigenous composite technology had achieved a
major milestone. The success of Nag also confirmed the
efficacy of the consortium approach, which had led to the
successful development of Agni.
Nag uses two key technologies—an Imaging Infra Red
(IIR) system and a Millimetric Wave (MMW) seeker radar
as its guiding eye. No single laboratory in the country
possessed the capability of developing these highly
advanced systems. But the urge to succeed existed, which
resulted in a very effective joint effort. The Semi Conductor
Complex at Chandigarh developed the Charge Coupled
Devices (CCD) array. The Solid Physics Laboratory, Delhi,
made the matching Mercury Cadmium Telluride (MCT)
detectors. The Defence Science Centre (DSC), Delhi, put
together an indigenous cooling system based on the Joules
Thomson effect. The transmitter receiver front end was
devised at the Defence Electronics Application Laboratory
(DEAL), Dehra Dun.
The special gallium arsenide gun, schottky barrier mixer
diodes, compact comparator for antenna system—India
was banned from buying any one of these high technology
devices, but innovation cannot be suppressed by
international restrictions.
I went to Madurai Kamaraj University the same month to
deliver their convocation address. When I reached
Madurai, I asked after my high school teacher Iyadurai
Solomon, who was by now a Reverend and eighty years
old. I was told that he lived in a suburb of Madurai, so I took
a taxi and looked for his house. Rev. Solomon knew that I
was going to give the convocation address that day.
However, he had no way of getting there. There was a
touching reunion between teacher and pupil. Dr PC
Alexander, the Governor of Tamil Nadu, who was presiding
over the function, was deeply moved on seeing the elderly
teacher who had not forgotten his pupil of long ago, and
requested him to share the dais.
“Every convocation day of every University is like
opening the floodgates of energy which, once harnessed by
institutions, organ-izations and industry, aids in nation-
building,” I told the young graduates. Somehow I felt I was
echoing Rev. Solomon’s words, spoken about half a
century ago. After my lecture, I bowed down before my
teacher. “Great dreams of great dreamers are always
transcended,” I told Rev. Solomon. “You have not only
reached my goals, Kalam! You have eclipsed them,” he told
me in a voice choked with emotion.
The next month, I happened to be in Trichi and used that
opportunity to visit St. Joseph’s College. I did not find Rev.
Father Sequeira, Rev. Father Erhart, Prof. Subramanyam,
Prof. Iyyamperumal Konar, or Prof. Thothathri Iyengar there,
but it seemed to me that the stones of the St. Joseph’s
building still carried the imprint of the wisdom of those great
people. I shared with the young students my memories of
St. Joseph’s and paid tribute to the teachers who had
moulded me.
We celebrated the nation’s forty-fourth Independence
Day with the test firing of Akash. Prahlada and his team
evaluated a new solid propellant booster system based on
a composite modified double base propellant. This
propellant with its unprecedented high energy properties
was crucial in assuring the long-range surface-to-air
missiles. The country had taken an important step in
ground-based air defence of vulnerable areas.
Towards the end of 1990, Jadavpur University
conferred on me the honour of Doctor of Science at a
special convocation. I was a little embarrassed at finding
my name mentioned along with that of the legendary Nelson
Mandela, who was also honoured at the same convocation.
What could I possible have in common with a legend like
Mandela? Perhaps it was our persistence in our missions.
My mission of advancing rocketry in my country was
perhaps nothing when compared with Mandela’s mission of
achieving dignity for a great mass of humanity; but there
was no difference in the intensity of our passions. “Be more
dedicated to making solid achievements than in running
after swift but synthetic happiness,” was my advice to the
young audience.
The Missile Council declared 1991 the Year of Initiative
for DRDL and RCI. When we chose the route of concurrent
engineering in IGMDP, we selected a rough track. With the
completion of developmental trials on Prithvi and Trishul,
our choice was on test now. I exhorted my colleagues to
commence user trials within the year. I knew that it was
going to be a tough task, but that was not going to
discourage us.
Rear Admiral Mohan retired and his deputy, Kapoor,
was to take over Trishul. I had always admired Mohan’s
understanding of missile command guidance. This sailor-
teacher-scientist could outwit any other expert in the country
in this field. I will always remember his candid exposition of
various aspects of the Command Line of Sight (CLOS)
guidance system during the Trishul meetings. Once, he
showed me a verse that he had composed to highlight the
woes of an IGMDP Project Director. It was a good way of
letting off steam:
I mpossible timeframes,
PERT charts to boot
Are driving me almost crazy as a coot;
Presentations to MC add to one’s woes,
If they solve anything, Heaven only knows.
Meetings on holidays, even at night,
The family is fed up,
And all ready to fight.
My hands are itching
to tear my hair —
But alas! I haven’t any more to tear ...
I told him, “I have handed over all my problems to my
best teams in DRDL, RCI, and other participating labs.
That has given me a full head of hair.”
The year 1991 began on a very ominous note. On the
night of 15 January 1991, the Gulf War broke out between
Iraq and the Allied Forces led by the USA. In one stroke,
thanks to satellite television invading Indian skies by that
time, rockets and missiles captured the imagination of the
entire nation. People started discussing Scuds and
Patriots in coffee houses and tea shops. Children began
flying paper kites shaped like missiles, and playing war
games along the lines of what they saw on American
television networks. The successful test firing of Prithvi and
Trishul during the course of the Gulf War was enough to
make an anxious nation relax. The newspaper reports of
the programmable trajectory capability of the Prithvi and
Trishul guidance system, using microwave frequencies in
virtually 
unjammable 
bands, 
created 
widespread
awareness. The nation was quick to draw parallels
between the missiles operational in the Gulf War and our
own warhead carriers. A common query I encountered was
whether Prithvi was superior to a Scud, whether Akash
could perform like a Patriot, and so on. Hearing a “Yes” or
a “Why not?” from me, people’s faces would light up with
pride and satisfaction.
The Allied Forces had a marked technological edge, as
they were fielding systems built using the technologies of
the eighties and nineties. Iraq was fighting with the by-and-
large vintage weapon systems of the sixties and seventies.
Now, this is where the key to the modern world order
lies— superiority through technology. Deprive the opponent
of the latest technology and then dictate your terms in an
unequal contest. When the Chinese war philosopher, Sun
Tzu ruminated over 2000 years ago that what matters in
war is not decimating the enemy army physically but
breaking his will so as to make him concede defeat in the
mind, he seems to have visualized the domination of
technology in the twentieth century theatres of war. The
missile force coupled with the electronic warfare used in
the Gulf War was a feast for military strategic experts. It
acted as a curtainraiser for the twenty-first century war
scenario with missiles and electronic and information
warfare playing the lead roles.
In India, even today, the term technology, for most
people, conjures up images of smoky steel mills or clanking
machines. This is a rather inadequate conception of what
technology denotes. The invention of the horse collar in the
Middle Ages led to major changes in agricultural methods,
and was as much a technological advance as the invention
of the Bessemer furnace centuries later. Moreover,
technology includes techniques as well as the machines
that may or may not be necessary to apply them. It includes
ways to make chemical reactions occur, ways to breed fish,
eradicate weeds, light theatres, treat patients, teach
history, fight wars, or even prevent them.
Today, most advanced technological processes are
carried out far from assembly lines or open hearths. Indeed,
in electronics, in space technology, in most of the new
industries, relative silence and clean surroundings are
characteristic, even essential. The assembly line, with the
organization of armies of men, to carry out simple, routine
functions is an anachronism. Our symbols of technology
must change before we can keep pace with changes in
technology itself. We should never forget that technology
feeds on itself. Technology makes more technology
possible. In fact, technological innovation consists of three
stages linked together in a self-reinforcing cycle. First,
there is the creative stage, with the blueprint of a feasible
idea. This is made real by its practical application, and this
finally ends in its diffusion through society. The process is
then complete; the loop is closed when the diffusion of
technology embodying the new idea in its turn helps
generate new creative ideas. Today, all over the developed
world, the time gap between each of the steps in this cycle
has been shortened. In India, we are just progressing
towards that stage—closing the loop.
After the Gulf War concluded with the victory of the
technologically superior Allied Forces, over 500 scientists
of DRDL and RCI gathered to discuss issues that had
emerged. I posed a question before the assembly: was
technology or weapon symmetry with other nations feasible,
and if so, should it be attempted? The discussion led to
many more serious questions, such as, how to establish
effective electronic warfare support? How to make missile
development proceed apace with the development of
equally necessary systems like the LCA; and what were the
key areas where a push would bring progress?
At the end of a lively discussion spread over three
hours, the consensus emerged that there was no way to
redress asymmetry in military capability except to have the
same capability in specific areas as your potential
opponent. The scientists vowed to achieve a reduced CEP
in the accuracy of Prithvi’s delivery, perfecting the Ka band
guidance system for Trishul and realising all carbon-carbon
re-entry control surfaces for Agni by the end of the year. The
vow was later fulfilled. The year also saw tubelaunched Nag
flights, and the manoeuvre of Trishul at seven metres above
sea level, at speeds which exceeded three times the speed
of sound. The latter was a breakthrough in the development
of an indigenous ship-launched anti-sea-skimmer missile.
The same year, I received an honorary degree of
Doctor of Science from the IIT, Bombay. In the citation read
by Prof. B Nag on the occasion, I was described as “an
inspiration behind the creation of a solid technological
base from which India’s future aerospace programmes can
be launched to meet the challenges of the twenty-first
century”. Well, perhaps Prof. Nag was only being polite, but
I do believe that India will enter the next century with its own
satellite in geo-stationary orbit 36,000 km away in space,
positioned by its own launch vehicle. India will also become
a missile power. Ours is a country with tremendous vitality.
Even though the world may not see its full potential or feel
its full power, no one dare ignore it any more.
On 15 October, I turned sixty. I looked forward to
retirement and planned to open a school for the less
privileged children. My friend, Prof. P Rama Rao, who was
heading the Department of Science and Technology in the
Government of India, even struck up a partnership with me
to establish what he called the Rao-Kalam school. We were
unanimous in our opinion that carrying out certain missions
and reaching certain milestones, however important they
may be or however impressive they might appear to be, is
not all there is to life. But we had to postpone our plan as
neither of us was relieved from our post by the Government
of India.
It was during this period that I decided to put down my
memoirs and express my observations and opinions on
certain issues.
The biggest problem Indian youth faced, I felt, was a
lack of clarity of vision, a lack of direction. It was then that I
decided to write about the circumstances and people who
made me what I am today; the idea was not merely to pay
tribute to some individuals or highlight certain aspects of
my life. What I wanted to say was that no one, however
poor, underprivileged or small, need feel disheartened
about life. Problems are a part of life. Suffering is the
essence of success. As someone said:
God has not promised
Skies always blue,
Flower-strewn pathways
All our life through;
God has not promised
Sun without rain,
Joy without sorrow,
Peace without pain.
I will not be presumptuous enough to say that my life can
be a role model for anybody; but some poor child living in
an obscure place, in an underprivileged social setting may
find a little solace in the way my destiny has been shaped. It
could perhaps help such children liberate themselves from
the bondage of their illusory backwardness and
hopelessness. Irrespective of where they are right now, they
should be aware that God is with them and when He is with
them, who can be against them?
But God has promised
Strength for the day,
Rest for the labour
Light for the way.
It has been my observation that most Indians suffer
unnecessary misery all their lives because they do not know
how to manage their emotions. They are paralysed by
some sort of a psychological inertia. Phrases like ‘the next
best alternative’, ‘the only feasible option or solution’, and
‘till things take a turn for the better’ are commonplace in our
business conversations. Why not write about the deep-
rooted character traits which manifest themselves in such
widespread, selfdefeatist thought patterns and negative
behaviour? I have worked with many people and
organizations and have had to deal with people who were
so full of their own limitations that they had no other way to
prove their self-worth than by intimidating me. Why not write
about the victimization which is a hallmark of the tragedy of
Indian science and technology? And about the pathways to
organizational success? Let the latent fire in the heart of
every Indian acquire wings, and the glory of this great
country light up the sky.

Leaders
T
echnology, unlike science, is a group activity. It is not
based on individual intelligence, but on the interaction of
many people. I think the biggest success of IGMDP is not
the fact that in
record time the country acquired the capability of
making five state-ofthe-art missile systems but that through
it, some superb teams of scientists and engineers have
been created. If someone asks me about my personal
achievements in Indian rocketry, I would put it down to
having created a challenging environment for teams of
young people to work in.
In their formative stages, teams are much like children
in spirit. They are as excitable, as full of vitality, enthusiasm,
curiosity and the desire to please and excel. As with
children, however, these positive attributes can be
destroyed by the behaviour of misguided parents. For
teams to be successful, the environment must offer scope
for innovation. I confronted many such challenges during the
course of my work at DTD&P (Air), ISRO, DRDO and
elsewhere, but always ensured for my teams an
environment which allowed innovation and risk-taking.
When we first began creating project teams during the
SLV-3 project and later in IGMDP, people working in these
teams found themselves in the frontline of their
organizations’ ambitions. Since a great deal of
psychological investment had been made in these teams,
they became both highly visible and highly vulnerable. They
were personally expected to make a disproportionate
contribution to win collective glory.
I was aware that any failure in the organizational support
system would negate the investment in team strategies.
The teams would be relegated to the league of average
working groups and might fail even there, unable to meet
the high expectations set for them. On several occasions,
the organization was on the verge of losing its nerve and
imposing restraints. The high level of uncertainty and
complexity associated with team activity very often proves
to be a trap for the unwary.
In the early years of the SLV-3 project, I often had to
counter nervousness of the top people because progress
was not tangibly or immediately visible. Many felt that the
organization had lost control over SLV-3, that the team
would run on unchecked, and cause chaos and confusion.
But on all occasions, these fears were proved imaginary.
There were many people in powerful positions in
organizations, for example at VSSC, who underestimated
our responsibility and commitment to organizational
objectives. Dealing with such people was a crucial part of
the whole operation, and this was performed dexterously by
Dr Brahm Prakash.
When you work as a project team, you need to develop
a complex view of the success criteria. There are always
multiple and often conflicting sets of expectations that exist
about a team’s performance. Then, quite often, the project
teams are virtually torn apart in their attempt to
accommodate the needs and constraints of sub-
contractors outside the organization and specialist
departments within the organization. Good project teams
are able to quickly identify the key person or people with
whom negotiations must take place. A crucial aspect of the
team leader’s role is to negotiate with these key people for
their requirements, and to ensure that the dialogue
continues on a regular basis as the situation develops or
changes. If there is one thing outsiders dislike, it is
unpleasant surprises. Good teams ensure that there are
none.
The SLV-3 team developed their own internal success
criteria. We articulated our standards, expectations and
objectives. We summarised what was needed to happen
for us to be successful and how we would measure
success. For instance, how we were going to accomplish
our tasks, who would do what and according to what
standards, what were the time limits and how would the
team conduct itself with reference to others in the
organization.
The process of arriving at the success criteria within a
team is an intricate and skilled one because there are a lot
of things going on below the surface. On the surface, the
team is simply working to achieve the project’s goals. But I
have repeatedly seen how people are poor at articulating
what they want—until they see a work centre doing
something they don’t want them to do. A project team
member must in fact act like a detective. He should probe
for clues as to how the project is proceeding, and then
piece together different bits of evidence to build up a clear,
comprehensive and deep understanding of the project’s
requirements.
At another level, the relationship between the project
teams and the work centres should be encouraged and
developed by the project leader. Both parties must be very
clear in their minds about their mutual interdependence and
the fact that both of them have a stake in the project. At yet
another level, each side should assess the other’s
capabilities and identify areas of strength and weakness in
order to plan what needs doing and how it should be done.
In fact, the whole game can be seen as a process of
contracting. It is about exploring and arriving at an
agreement on what each party expects of the other; about
realistically understanding the constraints of the other party;
and about communicating the success criteria while
defining some simple rules about how the relationship is to
work; but above all, it’s the best means of developing clarity
in the relationship, both at the technical and personal levels,
in order to avoid any nasty surprises in the future. In
IGMDP, Sivathanu Pillai and his team did some
remarkable work in this area through their home-grown
technique, PACE, which stands for Programme Analysis,
Control and Evaluation. Each day between 12 noon and 1
p.m., they would sit with a project team and a particular
work centre that was on the critical path and assess the
level of success among themselves. The excitement of
planning ways to succeed and the vision of future success
provide an irresistible form of motivation which, I have
found, always makes things happen.
The concept of Technology Management has its roots in
the Developmental Management models which originated
in the early Sixties out of a conflict between harmony-
seeking and output-oriented management structures. There
are basically two types of management orientations: primal,
which values an economic employee, and rational, which
values an organizational employee. My concept of
management is woven around an employee who is a
technology person. While the primal management school
recognizes people for their independence, and rational
management acknowledges them for their dependability, I
value them for their interdependence. Whereas the primal
manager champions independent enterprise and the
rational 
manager 
serves 
cooperation, 
I 
moot
interdependent joint ventures, getting the forces together,
networking people, resources, time schedules, costs, and
so on.
Abraham Maslow was the first person to suggest the
new psychology of self-actualization at a conceptual level. In
Europe, Rudolf Steiner and Reg Revans developed this
concept into the system of individual learning and
organizational renewal. The Anglo-German management
philosopher, Fritz Schumacher introduced Buddhist
economics and authored the concept of “Small is
Beautiful”. In the Indian subcontinent, Mahatma Gandhi
emphasized grass root level technology and put the
customer at the centre of the entire business activity. JRD
Tata brought in progressdriven infrastructure. Dr Homi
Jehangir Bhabha and Prof. Vikram Sarabhai launched the
high, technology-based atomic energy and space
programmes with a clear-cut emphasis on the natural laws
of totality and flow. Advancing the developmental
philosophy of Dr Bhabha and Prof. Sarabhai, Dr MS
Swaminathan ushered the Green Revolution into India
working on another natural principle of integrity. Dr
Verghese Kurien brought in a powerful cooperative
movement through a revolution in the dairy industry. Prof.
Satish Dhawan developed mission management concepts
in space research. These are but a few examples of
individuals who have not only articulated but also
implemented their ideas, thus changing forever the face of
research and business organizations all over the world.
In the IGMDP, I attempted to integrate the vision of Prof.
Sarabhai and the mission of Prof. Dhawan by adapting the
high technology setting of Dr Brahm Prakash’s space
research. I attempted to add the natural law of Latency in
founding the Indian Guided Missile Programme in order to
create a completely indigenous variety of technology
management. Let me use a metaphor to illuminate this.
The tree of technology management takes root only if
there is the self-actualization of needs, renewal,
interdependence, and natural flow. The growth patterns are
characteristic of the evolution process, which means that
things move in a combination of slow change and sudden
transformation; each transformation causes either a leap
into a new, more complex level or a devastating crash to
some earlier level; dominant models reach a certain peak
of success when they turn troublesome; and the rate of
change always accelerates.
The stem of the tree is the molecular structure in which
all actions are formative, all policies are normative, and all
decisions are integrative. The branches of this tree are
resources, assets, operations, and products which are
nourished by the stem through a continuous performance
evaluation and corrective update.
This tree of technology management, if carefully tended,
bears the fruits of an adaptive infrastructure: technological
empowerment of the institutions, the generation of technical
skills among people, and finally self-reliance of the nation
and improvement in the quality of life of its citizenry.
When IGMDP was sanctioned in 1983, we did not have
an adequate technology base. A few pockets of expertise
were available, but we lacked the authority to utilize that
expert technology. The multi-project environment of the
programme provided a challenge, for five advanced missile
systems had to be simultaneously developed. This
demanded judicious sharing of resources, establishing
priorities, and ongoing induction of manpower. Eventually,
the IGMDP had 78 partners, including 36 technology
centres and 41 production centres spread over public
sector undertakings, ordnance factories, private industries,
and professional societies, hand-in hand with a well-knit
bureaucratic structure in the Government. In the
management of the Programme, as much as in the
technological inputs, we attempted to develop a model that
was appropriate, even tailor-made, for our very specific
needs and capabilities. We borrowed ideas that had been
developed elsewhere, but adapted them in the light of what
we knew were our strengths and what we recognized as the
constraints we would be compelled to work under. All in all,
the combination of appropriate management and our
cooperative endeavours helped to unearth the talent and
potential that lay unused in our research laboratories,
government institutions and private industries.
The Technology Management philosophy of IGMDP is
not exclusive to missile development. It represents the
national urge to succeed and an awareness that the world
will never again be directed by muscle or money power. In
fact, both these powers will depend on technological
excellence. Technology respects only technology. And, as I
said in the beginning, technology, unlike science, is a group
activity. It does not grow only through individual intelligence,
but by intelligences interacting and ceaselessly individual
intelligence, but by intelligences interacting and ceaselessly
strong Indian family which also makes missile systems.
There has been much speculation and philosophizing
about the life and times of our scientists, but not enough
exploration in determining where they wanted to go and
how they reached there. In sharing with you the story of my
struggle to become a person, I have perhaps given you
some insight into this journey. I hope it will help at least a
few young people to stand up to the authoritarianism in our
society. 
A 
characteristic 
feature 
of 
this 
social
authoritarianism is its insidious ability to addict people to
the endless pursuit of external rewards, wealth, prestige,
position, promotion, approval of one’s lifestyle by others,
ceremonial honours, and status symbols of all kinds.
To successfully pursue these goals, they have to learn
elaborate rules of etiquette and familiarize themselves with
customs, traditions, protocols and so on. The youth of today
must unlearn this self-defeating way of life. The culture of
working only for material possessions and rewards must be
discarded. When I see wealthy, powerful and learned
people struggling to be at peace with themselves, I
remember people like Ahmed Jallaluddin and Iyadurai
Solomon. How happy they were with virtually no
possessions!
On the coast of Coromandel
Where the earthy shells blow,
In the middle of the sands
Lived some really rich souls.
One cotton lungi and half a candle –
One old jug without a handle
These were all the worldly possessions
Of these kings in the middle of the sands.
How did they feel so secure without anything to fall back
upon? I believe they drew sustenance from within. They
relied more on the inner signals and less on the external
cues that I have mentioned above. Are you aware of your
inner signals? Do you trust them? Have you taken control
over your life into your own hands? Take this from me, the
more decisions you can make avoiding external pressures,
which will constantly try to manipulate you, the better your
life will be, the better your society will become. Infact the
entire nation will benefit by having strong, inwardlooking
people as their leaders. A citizenry that thinks for itself, a
country of people who trust themselves as individuals,
would be virtually immune to manipulation by any
unscrupulous authority or vested interest.
Your willingness to use your own inner resources to
invest in your life, especially your imagination, will bring you
success. When you address a task from your own uniquely
individual standpoint, you become a whole person.
Everyone on this planet is sent forth by Him to cultivate
all the creative potential within us and live at peace with our
own choices. We differ in the way we make our choices
and evolve our destiny. Life is a difficult game. You can win
only by retaining your birthright to be a person. And to retain
this right, you will have to be willing to take the social or
external risks involved in ignoring pressures to do things
the way others say they should be done. What will you call
Sivasubramania Iyer inviting me to have lunch in his
kitchen? Zohara, my sister, mortgaging her gold bangles
and chains to get me into engineering college? Prof.
Sponder insisting that I should sit with him in the front row
for the group photograph? Making a hovercraft in a motor-
garage setup? Sudhakar’s courage? Dr Brahm Prakash’s
support? Narayanan’s management? Venkataraman’s
vision? Arunachalam’s drive? Each is an example of a
strong inner strength and initiative. As Pythagoras had said
twenty-five centuries ago, “Above all things, reverence
yourself.”
I am not a philosopher. I am only a man of technology. I
spent all my life learning rocketry. But as I have worked with
a very large crosssection of people in different
organizations, I had an opportunity to understand the
phenomenon of professional life in its bewildering
complexity. When I look back upon what I have narrated so
far, my own observations and conclusions appear as
dogmatic utterances. My colleagues, associates, leaders;
the complex science of rocketry; the important issues of
technology management; all seem to have been dealt with
in a perfunctory manner. The despair and happiness, the
achievements and the failures—differing markedly in
context, time, and space—all appear grouped together.
When you look down from an aircraft, people, houses,
rocks, fields, trees, all appear as one homogeneous
landscape, it is very difficult to distinguish one from another.
What you have just read is a similar bird’seye view of my
life seen, as it were, from afar.
My worthiness is all my doubt –
His merit – all my fear –
Contrasting which my quality
Does however – appear.
This is the story of the period ending with the first Agni
launch—life will go on. This great country will make
enormous strides in all fields if we think like a united nation
of 900 million people. My story—the story of the son of
Jainulabdeen, who lived for over a hundred years on
Mosque Street in Rameswaram island and died there; the
story of a lad who sold newspapers to help his brother; the
story of a pupil reared by Sivasubramania Iyer and Iyadurai
Solomon; the story of a student taught by teachers like
Pandalai; the story of an engineer spotted by MGK Menon
and groomed by the legendary Prof. Sarabhai; the story of
a scientist tested by failures and setbacks; the story of a
leader supported by a large team of brilliant and dedicated
professionals. This story will end with me, for I have no
belongings in the worldly sense. I have acquired nothing,
built nothing, possess nothing—no family, sons, daughters.
I am a well in this great land
Looking at its millions of boys and girls
To draw from me
The inexhaustible divinity
And spread His grace everywhere
As does the water drawn from a well.
I do not wish to set myself up as an example to others,
but I believe that a few readers may draw inspiration and
come to experience that ultimate satisfaction which can
only be found in the life of the spirit. God’s providence is
your inheritance. The bloodline of my greatgrandfather Avul,
my grandfather Pakir, and my father Jainulabdeen may end
with Abdul Kalam, but His grace will never cease, for it is
Eternal.

Epilogue
This book is interwoven with my deep involvement with
India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle SLV-3 and Agni
Programmes, an involvement which eventually led to my
participation in the recent important national event related
to the nuclear tests in May, 1998. I have had the great
opportunity and honour of working with three scientific
establishments— Space, Defence Research and Atomic
Energy. I found, while working in these establishments, that
the best of human beings and the best of innovative minds
were available in plenty. One feature common to all three
establishments, is that the scientists and technologists
were never afraid of failures during their missions. Failures
contain within themselves the seeds of further learning
which can lead to better technology, and eventually, to a
high level of success. These people were also great
dreamers and their dreams finally culminated in
spectacular achievements. I feel that if we consider the
combined technological strength of all these scientific
institutions, it would certainly be comparable to the best
found anywhere in the world. Above all, I have had the
opportunity of working with the great visionaries of the
nation, namely Prof. Vikram Sarabhai, Prof. Satish Dhawan
and Dr Brahm Prakash, each of whom have greatly
enriched my life.
A nation needs both economic prosperity and strong
security for growth and development. Our Self Reliance
Mission in Defence System 1995– 2005 will provide the
Armed Forces with a state-of-the-art competitive weapons
system. The Technology Vision – 2020 plan will put into
place certain schemes and plans for the economic growth
and prosperity of the nation. These two plans have evolved
out of the nation’s dreams. I
